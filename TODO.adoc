= What to do

[x] styling of links and code
[x] styling of tables that're somehow broken
[] is possible to generate TOC?
[x] why RSS generation does not work; it works fine! the plugin renders the xml only when `yarn gatsby build; yarn gatsby server`, it does not work properly with `gatsby develop` that I've used on testing
[] could be used the icons? if not it's necessary to remove things like `icon:smile-o[]` from the adoc sources
[x] the social image should be shown in the article listing
[x] tag (and category) pages show wrong items
[] how about comments
[] does the google analytics work?
