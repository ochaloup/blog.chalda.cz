I wanted to write a Maven plugin with no experience on it.
This is a short summary on my takeaways.

As first step I would recommend Maven Apache documentation short tutorial at
https://maven.apache.org/guides/plugin/guide-java-plugin-development.html. And then... icon:smile-o[]
== Archetype scaffolding

You can start with the Maven archetype generator

```bash
mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=org.apache.maven -DartifactId=maven-plugin-test -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-mojo -DinteractiveMode=false
```

Maven generates the scaffolder of the Maven plugin project. Check the `pom.xml` of the generated project and its dependencies. There is provided dependency `org.apache.maven:maven-plugin-api` which provides parent class `AbstractMojo` for starting to write a Maven plugin. The generator then introduces class `or.apache.maven.MyMojo`. Check there the javadoc annotations used to define properties of the plugin.
The documentation for this approach could be found at
https://books.sonatype.com/mvnref-book/reference/writing-plugins-sect-mojo-params.html.
I haven't written the plugin this way but I changed for using Maven annnotations.

== Maven plugin creation

=== Plugin project dependencies

I took the project and add these dependencies to the `pom.xml`.

```xml
<!-- basic Maven plugin dependency containing `AbstractMojo` class as parent
     to all Maven plugin instances -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.maven</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-plugin-api</artifactId>
    <version>3.5.2</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
<!-- annotation used for plugin properties definitions and injecting Maven objects -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugin-tools</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-plugin-annotations</artifactId>
    <version>3.5.1</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
<!-- Introducing Maven objects `MavenProject`, `PluginDescriptor` etc. -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.maven</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-core</artifactId>
    <version>3.5.2</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
```

NOTE: I'm not sure about the correct `scope` but the `provided` works for me.

=== Source code definition

The Maven plugin consists from one (or several) classes which inherit from class `org.apache.maven.plugin.AbstractMojo`.
When inherited it forces you to implement method `execute()` which is called when the plugin is invoked.
The plugin is introduced by annotation `@Mojo` (_Maven plain Old Java Object_ )
marking the class as the Maven plugin, assigning the name of executable `goal`.
You can create multiple Mojo classes in your project and cover more goals.

```java
import org.apache.maven.plugin.AbstractMojo;

@Mojo(name = "go-test")
public class MavenPluginTest extends AbstractMojo {

  @Override
    public void execute() throws MojoExecutionException, MojoFailureException     {
    }
}
```

To get executed your plugin in the referenced project you will add this to the `pom.xml`

```xml
<build>
   <plugins>
     <plugin>
       <groupId>org.apache.maven</groupId>
       <artifactId>maven-test-plugin</artifactId>
       <version>...</version>
       <executions>
         <execution>
           <phase>process-classes</phase>
           <goals>
             <goal>go-test</goal>
           </goals>
         </execution>
       </executions>
     </plugin>
   </plugins>
 </build>
```

NOTE: you can define multiple `<execution>` elements (e.g. with different configuration), you can use multiple `<goal>` elements to get them executed

=== Plugin parametrized

The plugin can be parametrized by using `@Parameter` annotation. This provides
way of passing values from the `pom.xml` to the plugin code execution.
Let's say you want to  provide name of the
http://www.thinkcode.se/blog/2014/05/21/use-maven-build-directory-in-your-plugin[build directory for your plugin]
which is resolved for `./target/classes`. The project executing the plugin defines in `pom.xml`

```xml
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.apache.maven</groupId>
  <artifactId>maven-test-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>...</version>
  <configuration>
    <buildDirectory>${project.build.directory}</buildDirectory>
  </configuration>
  <executions>
    <execution>
      <phase>process-classes</phase>
      <goals>
        <goal>go-test</goal>
      </goals>
    </execution>
  </executions>
</plugin>
```

NOTE: the `<configuration>` element could be part of the `<execution>` element too

```java
@Mojo(name = "go-test")
public class MavenPluginTest extends AbstractMojo {

  @Parameter
  private String buildDirectory;

  @Override
  public void execute() throws MojoExecutionException, MojoFailureException {
  }
}
```

We've used the simple `@Parameter` annotation. This annotation offers several attributes.
We can define the default value as the project build folder while using in form of Maven variable `@Parameter(defaultValue = "${project.build.directory}")`.

A bit trouble is with multi value (array type) parameter. The `defaultValue` is not evaluated.
This `@Parameter(defaultValue = "${project.build.directory}") private String[] buildPaths` does not work.
We can define the default value by direct assignment
`@Parameter private String[] buildPaths = new String()["${project.build.directory}"]` which works but it does not evaluate the stig form of the Maven configuration property.

Maven brings several classes that could be used for getting information from the Maven
execution. One of them is `org.apache.maven.project.MavenProject` that could be
injected to `@Parameter` annotation and then queried for things like build directory.
One way of solving this is

```java
@Parameter
private String[] buildPaths;

@Parameter(defaultValue = "${project}", readonly = true, required = true)
protected MavenProject project;

@Override
public void execute() throws MojoExecutionException, MojoFailureException {
  if(buildPaths == null) buildPaths
    = new String[] {project.getBuild().getOutputDirectory()};

  getLog().info("provided buildPath is '" + Arrays.asList(buildPaths) + "'");
}
```

Here I use the `getLog()` method declared in the `AbstractMojo` providing the
Maven log - driven by Maven execution parameters (e.g. debug is switch on while run `mvn install -X`).

The nice brief summary of the annotations and the Maven classes to be used in the Maven plugin
is provided at https://maven.apache.org/plugin-tools/maven-plugin-tools-annotations

=== Definition of default phase

The `@Mojo` annotation provides way of defininig default phase for the plugin being
executed. Then this information is not needed to be part of the definition of the `pom.xml`
(you can omit `<phase>` element under `<execution>`).

For list of the lifecycles and their phases look at
http://www.avajava.com/tutorials/lessons/what-are-the-phases-of-the-maven-default-lifecycle.html

```java
@Mojo(name = "go-test", defaultPhase = LifecyclePhase.PROCESS_CLASSES)
public class MavenPluginTest extends AbstractMojo {
```

```xml
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.apache.maven</groupId>
  <artifactId>maven-test-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>...</version>
  <executions>
    <execution>
      <goals>
        <goal>go-test</goal>
      </goals>
    </execution>
  </executions>
</plugin>
```

Consult the documentation to check all the annotations offered by Maven annotations artifact and their parameters
http://maven.apache.org/developers/mojo-api-specification.html

== Class loading troubles

I needed to create a plugin which takes a list of paths which will be scanned for
classes and then loaded. I found that the I need to get a bit into classloading
scheme of the Maven plugin. You can check the explanation at http://takari.io/book/91-maven-classloading.html.

My trouble was that `Class.forName("cz.chalda.MyClass")` was not resolved with the restricted classpath
enriched with the dependencies taken during project compilation.
Normally (at least I understand this) the plugin can see dependencies defined in `compile` scope
of the plugin project itself. Not the project it's referenced in (the project the plugin is executed at).

This could be shown with use of `PluginDescriptor` Maven class. You can verify it with the following code snippet

```java
@Parameter( defaultValue = "${plugin}", readonly = true )
private PluginDescriptor pluginDescriptor;

// -- or --

final PluginDescriptor pluginDescriptor = (PluginDescriptor) getPluginContext().get("pluginDescriptor");

// printing the ClassRealm content containing plugin classpath dependencies
final ClassRealm classRealm = pluginDescriptor.getClassRealm();
for(URL url: classRealm.getURLs()) getLog().info(" >>> " + url.toString());
```

[NOTE]
====
The `ClassRealm` can be enriched by URL to broad class loading scope

```java
final File classes = new File(getProject().getBuild().getOutputDirectory());
try {
  classRealm.addURL(classes.toURI().toURL());
} catch (MalformedURLException e) {
  getLog().error("Can't create URL from path to project output directory '"
    + getProject().getBuild().getOutputDirectory() + "'", e)
}
```
====

If you want to get the classpath depenedencies from the project the plugin is executed at,
you can use the following code snippet

```java
@Mojo(name = "go-test", requiresDependencyResolution = ResolutionScope.COMPILE)
public class MavenPluginTest extends AbstractMojo {

  @Parameter(defaultValue = "${project}", readonly = true, required = true)
  protected MavenProject project;

  @Override
  public void execute() throws MojoExecutionException, MojoFailureException {

    // listing the Maven project class path of compile and runtime
    try {
        getLog().info(("compile cp: " +
          this.project.getCompileClasspathElements());
        getLog().info(("runtime cp: " +
          this.project.getRuntimeClasspathElements());
    } catch (DependencyResolutionRequiredException e) {
        new MojoExecutionException("Dependency resolution failed", e);
    }
  }
}
```

You can see I used the `@Mojo` annotation attribute `requiresDependencyResolution`
defining that the depenedencies should be resolved for this plugin. If it's not
used (at least in my experience) the list of the compile class path elements
will contains only path `./target/classes` but not the list of the Maven project dependencies
of `compile` scope, which was desired.

With these I could create my own class loader and particularly say what is the scope of the class loading
(you can check other notes on this over here http://blog.semsur-it.com/2011/11/java-class-loader-and-maven-plugin.html)

```java
List<URL> pathUrls = new ArrayList<>();
for(String mavenCompilePath: project.getCompileClasspathElements()) {
    currentPathProcessed = mavenCompilePath;
    pathUrls.add(new File(mavenCompilePath).toURI().toURL());
}

URL[] urlsForClassLoader = pathUrls.toArray(new URL[pathUrls.size()]);
getLog().debug("urls for URLClassLoader: " + Arrays.asList(urlsForClassLoader));

// need to define parent classloader which knows all dependencies of the plugin
classLoader = new URLClassLoader(urlsForClassLoader, MavenPluginTest.class.getClassLoader());
```

=== Note: class loader debugging

I found it's handy to understand what are the resources the particular class loader works with.
Thus I took inspiration from
http://www.java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0125__Reflection/AnalyzeClassLoaderhierarchyforanygivenobjectorclassloader.htm
and adjusted for my purposes
https://github.com/ochaloup/class-loader-debug/blob/master/src/main/java/cz/chalda/classloader/ClassLoaderUtils.java

With this you can get printed the tree of the classloaders (up to the parent one) and check what is the classpath
the class loader works with.

NOTE: bear in mind the _normal_ java classloader first ask parent if the resource is known and then it tries to resolve it himself. This is reflected in the printing (ie. you can see the child classloader prints it can work with what the parent classloader is capable too). +
See https://zeroturnaround.com/rebellabs/rebel-labs-tutorial-do-you-really-get-classloaders/2/.

The usage of the `ClassLoaderUtils` class could be in way

```java
System.out.printf("%n--%ncontext class loader hierarchy: %s",
  ClassLoaderUtils.showClassLoaderHierarchy(
    Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader()));
System.out.printf("%n--%nplugin class loader hierarchy: %s",
  ClassLoaderUtils.showClassLoaderHierarchy(
    MavenPluginTest.class.getClassLoader()));
```
