= Installation of HubPress.io

Writing blogposts is a proof-of-concept for me having them as a knowledgebase.
For a some time when writing any note I use http://asciidoctor.org[AsciiDoc(tor)] format.
Thus I started to search for option that allows me to write blog-notes that way too.

I could see that many people host blogs at http://github.io I decided to try that way too.
I started by looking for a tool to generate static webpages with http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-asciidoctor-diffs[AsciiDoc] support.
There is the mostly used `Jekyll` - written in ruby, generating a webpage from template
on your local machine. There is https://github.com/asciidoctor/jekyll-asciidoc[plugin for AsciiDoc].
Other tool that I was evaluating was http://awestruct.org[:awestruct].

Then I found http://hubpress.io[HubPress.io] that has a concept of a webapp whole written in javascript
which generates static website directly in your browser sending it then to GitHub repo. Merit of this approach
is a nice admin console in your browser. Flaw is a little bit longer waiting time to get post being published.
The other could be current
http://blog.hubpress.io/2016/10/11/We-Arent-Dead-Yet-Hub-Press-Roadmap.html[stall in the development process]. But it seems not be fully true as there is new versions coming (see
https://github.com/HubPress/hubpress.io/commit/ceaca97655fd3a49e4bc057201f0eb7109ad2d4a[0.8.0]).

So far so good. I decided to give it a try.

Process of installation is quite simple - you https://github.com/HubPress/hubpress.io[fork repo],
https://github.com/HubPress/hubpress.io/blob/master/hubpress/config.json[change config file]
and you can start to write a blog posts inside of the administration console.

Nevertheless check https://hubpress.gitbooks.io/hubpress-knowledgebase[knowledgebase to HubPress]
and https://github.com/HubPress/dev.hubpress.io/blob/gh-pages/README.adoc[documentation on GitHub].

...or if you plan to run `HubPress.io` blog against your custom domain these steps could be helpful for you

. Fork repo
** Fork https://github.com/HubPress/hubpress.io[github repository] and set `gh-pages`
https://github.com/HubPress/dev.hubpress.io/blob/gh-pages/README.adoc#use-a-custom-domain-or-github-page-domain-already-in-use[as default one].
** set the `custom domain` field to name of your domain

[NOTE]
====
Having set the `custom domain` will cause creation of `CNAME` file under root
of your github repository.

The content of the file is just the name of your custom domain - thus what you
put to the field.

. change `hubpress/config.json` file to contain (meta)data
** username
** repositoryName
** branch
** cname
in my case it was like this

```

{
  "meta": {
    "username": "ochaloup",
    "repositoryName": "blog.chalda.cz",
    "branch": "gh-pages",
    "cname": "blog.chalda.cz",
}, ...
```

[NOTE]
====
`config.json` file serves to HubPress.io as a configuration file so all settings
that you will set in administration interface will be saved here
====

. When all is set fine you can now go to `HubPress.io` admin page which is
hidden under subaddress `hubpress`. In my case it's at path http://blog.chalda.cz/hubpress.
You need to log in with credentials which you use to login to GitHub. HubPress.io calls
directly the GitHub identification service to confirm that you are the owner of the repo.

. Afte the first login you can see empty screen. That's ok and just create a new article. +
[Updated] for version `0.8.0` it seems that there is already shown information that you have 0 posts so it's not misleading already.

. For https://disqus.com[Disqus] you need short name for your site to be set in HubPress.io.
You will find it when already having page under Discusq when you go `Admin` -> `Settings`
-> choose page -> `General` -> `Shortname`

// TODO: how to add theme...

That's more or less it. Now it's time to write and experiment.

=== Troubleshooting

* it happens to me time to time that I'm not able to save or publish an article. It seems to happen when I want to change the publish tag of the article (which is probably not directly expected but it's not obvious. I get
```
Requestable.js:50 Uncaught (in promise) Error: 401 error making request GET https://api.github.com/repos/ochaloup/blog.chalda.cz/git/refs/heads/gh-pages: "Unauthorized"
    at new t (Requestable.js:50)
    at Requestable.js:385
    at <anonymous>
```
My workaround is to copy text to some text editor on my computer, remove the post completely and re-add it again.
