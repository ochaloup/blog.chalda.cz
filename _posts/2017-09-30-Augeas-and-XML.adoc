== Augeas... what?

The name Augeas is based on greek legend about Herakles who has to clean stables
of the king Augeas from dung as one of his twelve laubours that he has to fulfill as a punishment
for killing his wife and children (for a justification he was driven mad by Hera).

http://augeas.net[Augueas referenced here is a tool] for doing changes in textual configuration files.
It's purpose came from fact that whole Linux configuration is based on text files.
If you want to do some changes automatically by a script you are usually doomed
to use `sed` or `awk`. Augeas is expected to do the task easier.
I was looking for a tool for doing changes of WildFly `standalone.xml` and I don't like
XSLT thus I was searching for some alternatives.
This idea to use Augeas came to my mind from nice video presentation of usage JBoss with Docker.
It was one part from series of Virtual JBoss User Group
presentations (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4uQ6gR_xZhE[Docker and JBoss - the perfect combination]).
The presentation was lead by https://goldmann.pl/blog[Marek Goldmann] who does have really nice post
about topic of automatic changes of JBoss configuration file at his blog
- https://goldmann.pl/blog/2014/07/23/customizing-the-configuration-of-the-wildfly-docker-image.

== How the Augeas works

Augeas provides machinery but there has to be a 'recipy' which defines semantics of particular
configuration files. This recipy is called `lens` in terms of Augeas tooling.
`Lens` describes format of your configuration. By default Augeas provides `lenses` for standard files
residing under `/etc` directory. If you want to work with some other file you need to find a lens for your one
(see http://augeas.net/stock_lenses.html[Augeas built-in lenses]) or, when not provided,
you have two options -use some generic `lens` and be more verbose when changing configuration,
or write your own `lens`.

As I want to change XML file I needed to use `xml lens` for Augeas to know how to parse the file.
This provided lens is a simple in way that it doesn't take care about any schema or namespace.
It just take the XML file as a text and separates tag (elements) from text and attributes.
The data is structured in a tree consisting nodes. Each node contains two strings `label` (a node name) and `value`.
You can point to each node with path expression similar to `XPath`
(see https://github.com/hercules-team/augeas/wiki/Path-expressions [Path Expressions in Augeas]).

== Augeas usage

For the work you will use command *augtool*.

Augeas is part of the most Linux distributions. If it's not your case,
you can install it from the package - in Fedora it's package named augeas (`dnf install augeas`) - or
you can simply http://augeas.net/download.html[download it] and put the `augtool` command on the `PATH`.

When you run *augtool* and you get an interactive shell where
you can start typing Augeas commands. When it's run with some undefined parameter (e.g. `-h` is one of them icon:smile-o[])
then you will get list of possible options to use.

When I came to augeas tool first I was searching for a way to pass a set of rules (augeas commands)
and define a file that the rules will be applied to. But Augeas does not work in this way. You need to understand
the structure of Augeas tree and how it works with its nodes.
The Augeas wiki page https://github.com/hercules-team/augeas/wiki#Using_Augeas is quite informative in this matter.

Let's examine a bit the `augtool` here

If you run the `augtool` there are tree base commands which are your friends icon:smile-o[] - *print*, *ls* and *match*.
These commands are used to get information about the structure of the Augeas tree.
*Print* and *match* do mostly the same. The *print* scrawl, starting at the defined path,
down by the tree and print all nodes (labels and values). *Match* do similar but you influencing
what is printed by using subsitute characters as `\*` https://github.com/hercules-team/augeas/wiki/Path-expressions[similar to XPath queries].
Command *ls* just shows node names (labels) residing under the defined path.

== Augeas commands

Good start is to run command:

```bash
augtool
ls /
```

You can see that there are two base nodes - *augeas* and *files*.

* Node *augeas* is where configuration is saved.
* Node *files* is where all parsed data is saved.

If you want to make some change you use command *set*. For example you can try to list the `/etc/fstab`
file by

```bash
augtool
match /files/etc/fstab/*[label() = '#comment']
set /files/etc/fstab/#comment[1] "my strange comment"
save
```

On this example we can see that Augeas works with a copy of the content and changes
are write back to the filesystem when `save` command is called.

That was about config files and lenses loaded by Augeas automatically.
That is, there are defined lenses and files to be `autoloaded`.

You can can observe the structure of the Augeas tree - lenses and files by running

```bash
print /augeas
print /files
```

[WARNING]
====
Files don't poses the same placement in the Augeas tree as they have
int the file system.
====

[NOTE]
====
if you want to see all the autoloaded files try
```bash
match /augeas/load/*/incl
```
if you want to see all the autoloaded lenses try
```bash
ls /augeas/load
```
====

Because of all the autoloading the start of augtool could be a bit slower and if we know that
we want to work just with one specific file we can use *--noload* and *--noautoload* parameters.
In short run

```bash
augtool -LA
```

[TIP]
====
Try to run
```bash
augtool -LA
print /
```
and you will see nothing.
====

[NOTE]
====
Helpful parameters

* _-b_  (_--backup_) which says that original file will be backuped, before changes are saved,
  this parameter creates file with the same name but suffixed with `.augsave`
* _-e_  (_--echo_) which says that commands which are executed will be printed on stdout
* _-r_  (_--root_) definition of a specific directory as root of the Augeas file system,
  for example `-r .` says that the root will not be `/` but the current directory (still referenced under `/files/`)
====

With usage of `-LA` nothing is preloaded and we have to define ourselves what to work with.
Let's define a file to work with and lens for parsing it. When we change such _settings_
the `load` command has to be used to get activated (or reload the agutool iself).
We have to define type of file to work with by adding element under augeas load node. That could be arbitrary name but let's say _xml_ as we will work with xml.
As adding the xml node we define what is lens which defines rules for parsing.
This will be predefined name of the lens *Xml.lns* (see https://github.com/hercules-team/augeas/wiki/Loading-specific-files)

```bash
set /augeas/load/xml/lens Xml.lns
```

Now for definition what file to work with use absolute path to a file and put it under _xml_ element under node incl.

```bash
set /augeas/load/xml/incl /opt/jboss/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml
```

If there should be more files to load you can use the path expression

```bash
set /augeas/load/xml/incl /opt/jboss/standalone/configuration/*.xml
```

Or if you want to specify more files by your hand, you will need to use some of the technics
mentioned under https://github.com/hercules-team/augeas/wiki/Adding-nodes-to-the-tree. AS an example

```bash
set /augeas/load/xml/incl[1] /opt/jboss/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml
set /augeas/load/xml/incl[2] /opt/jboss/standalone/configuration/standalone-full.xml
```

And finally we need to load the data inside to augeas

```bash
load
```

[TIP]
====
If you don't use option `-LA` then xml lens is loaded under /augeas/load/Xml. You can then add there some file as
```bash
set /augeas/load/Xml/incl[1] /opt/jboss/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml
load
```
This has an 'advantage' that you are free from specifying lens definition at the start.
====

Now came the work with Augeas tree itself. As it was said the loaded files are under root node /files.
Let's define a variable to reuse it afterwards. We are going to work with the `standalone.xml` loaded here.
And the variable is _logging_ and will contain the Augeas tree of the logging subsystem

```bash
defvar logging /files/home/ochaloup/tmp/augeas/standalone.xml/server/profile/subsystem[#attribute/xmlns=~regexp('.*logging.*')]
```

...redefining logging level

```bash
set $logging/console-handler/level/#attribute/name "DEBUG"
set $logging/root-logger/level/#attribute/name "DEBUG"
```

...at the end save changes into the original file

```bash
save
```

...as final step it's good to check whether we are error free

```bash
print /augeas//error
```

If you want to work with some specific node and you don't know whether it's already existing
use command _defnode_. I wanted to define trace logging level for jca subsystem so I did following.

```bash
defnode logger_jca $logging/logger[#attribute/category='org.jboss.jca']
set $logger_jca/#attribute/category "org.jboss.jca"
defnode logger_jca_level $logger_jca/level
set $logger_jca_level/#attribute/name "TRACE"
```

Few final notes on working with xml converted to Augeas tree

* tags (xml elements) are converted to augeas nodes
* the attributes and text could be found under `#attribute` and `#text` node under the particular tag name
* when traversing the tree you can use `\*` as a definition of any value or you can use `//`
  to expect whatever number of nodes between current and the defined one.
  Try `//*[#attribute/xmlns=~regexp('.*logging.*')]`.
* check section https://github.com/hercules-team/augeas/wiki/Path-expressions#user-content-Tips_amp_Tricks[Tips and Trics in Augeas manual page].

== Running augtool non-interactive way

How to use `augtool` to define lenses and work files in an one step?

```bash
augtool -r . --noautoload --transform 'Xml.lns incl /standalone.xml'
```

This command says that you define root of the augtool to current directory.
There is automatically loaded no default lenses.
There is no default rules for loading any file.
Then you are defining to load `standalone.xml` (expected from the current directory)
and this file will be transformed by lens `Xml.lns`.
Now you are ready to run any of the commands mentioned above.

If you have commands to be executed by the Augeas tooling you can let the Augeas
to read it from a file (`-f` parameter) or pass it on the standard input.

```

I name the script as `augeas` and run it with parameter of what is the logging category to change
and adding the Augeas commands to be executed.

```bash
augeas -Dcategory=com.arjuna ~/scripts/augeasconf/logging.aug
```

The `logging.aug` looks

```bash
defvar logging \$file/server/profile/subsystem[#attribute/xmlns=~regexp('.*logging.*')]
defnode logger \$logging/logger[#attribute/category='${category:-com.arjuna}']
set \$logger/#attribute/category "$category"
defnode logger_level \$logger/level
set \$logger_level/#attribute/name "${level:-TRACE}"
```

There is a little bit magic of escaping with `\` as bash and `augtool` uses character `$` for similar
approach (variable definition) and I need to replace some of the values by bash variables and some
of the variables to be processed by Augeas itself.
