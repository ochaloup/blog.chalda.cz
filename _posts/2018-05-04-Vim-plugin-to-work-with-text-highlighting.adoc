Are you Vim user and have you ever investigated long server logs with multiple identifiers needed to be tracked? Check out my plugin https://github.com/ochaloup/vim-syntax-match[Vim syntax match] that can help you with it.

== Topic background

This happens to me quite often with WildFly and transaction identifiers.
Thus I was searching how to make my life easier in this respect. I found
that colorizing referred parts of the log helps me to follow and understand
what has happened.

Vim provides  `match` command (and its alternatives
`2match` and `3match`). You say what color to use and what text to mark with the color.
You do it in way `:match <color> /<pattern>/`. The example would be for `:match DiffAdd /2018-[^ ]*/`.
This expression colorize text starting with `2018-` up to the space in the text
with color named `DiffAdd`. You can search for available colors when you write
`:highlight` (shortcut as `:hi`). And you can define your own color with
`:hi <new-color-name> <terminal-type>=<color-code>` (see details at `:help hi`).
As an example `:hi yellow guibg=#dfff87 ctermbg=192` where we define a color name `yellow`
to colorize background with color of code `#dfff87` and `192` respectively.
Check the color codes for example here https://jonasjacek.github.io/colors/.

But this is restricted only to three text patterns to be highlighted. If you need
more you can define your own arbitrary syntax match rules with `:syntax match DiffAdd /2018-[^ ]*`.
This sounds fine but it requires more text typing than I liked. And I feel another pain point
- when I closed the log file and wanted to get back to investigation after a while
all the highlighting was lost.

== Vim synax match plugin

I decided to create a Vim plugin which addresses my objections and makes my life easier.
You can find it at https://github.com/ochaloup/vim-syntax-match

If you install it and wish to get highlighted the mentioned pattern you can write
only `:Y 2018-[^ ]*`.

What it brings?

* text highlighting shortcuts for several colors, like `:Y <pattern>` for yellow background or
  `:GF <pattern>` for green foreground
* saving the existing highlighting pattern to be loaded next time the file is opened
  (works with `.txt` and `.log` files)

Check all the helper commands at the https://github.com/ochaloup/vim-syntax-match#helper-commands[README file]
and you can read how https://github.com/ochaloup/vim-syntax-match#how-works-internally[this works in details there too].

== How to install

See guidelines at the `README` file https://github.com/ochaloup/vim-syntax-match#how-to-install.
In short you need to have installed http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2332[pathogen plugin]
and then just clone the https://github.com/ochaloup/vim-syntax-match[vim syntax match] respository
under folder `.vim/bundle`.

== Tips

* Do you know that you can open a secondary file as a vertical Vim window having
  those to being scrolled together? Try `:vsplit <path-to-file>` and `:set scrollbind`.
  Alternatively use plugin user command `:SCB`
* Do you know Vim can export the opened file as HTML page where highligting is applied?
  Try to run `:Tohtml`. Alternatively use the plugin user command `:TOHtmlWithLines`
  which adds _clicable_ line numbers on top of the output provided by `:Tohtml`.
