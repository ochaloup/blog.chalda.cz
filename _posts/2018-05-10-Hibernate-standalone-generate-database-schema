The motivation for this post was an attempt to use Hibernate as abstraction library
that is easily capable to work with different databases without need to direct
compile the code against particular jdbc driver.

What the preconditions were

* output is standalone java application
* code to be independent on jdbc driver
* being able to generate database schema independently on specific SQL syntax
  particular for each database type
* write and query data while the data structure is pretty simple




* SQL for PostgreSQL to query all tables:
* SELECT *  FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_type = 'BASE TABLE' AND table_schema = 'public' ORDER BY table_type, table_name
*
