image::articles/docker-tag.png[]

As a newcomer to the world of http://docker.io[Docker] and I struggle a bit with basic concepts. Here, I would like to summarize my observation about Docker tagging and repositories.

If you build a Dockerfile (`docker build .`) you get a docker image. That's identified with a hash. You can take it and
start it (`docker run <image_hash>`) as a docker container.
But using a hash hash as reference to an existing "app"
is just hard. How can a human remember and differentiate them? That's where you can name (_tag_) the image with command `docker tag <image_hash> <tag_name>`. When you do so
you can start the container then with `docker run <tag_name>`.

There is an convention about tag name in docker which is:

```
{REGISTRY}/{PROJECT}/{IMAGE_NAME}:{IMAGE_VERSION}
```

The format is not compulsory but the docker client understands the convention and it's what the commands `docker pull`/`docker push` work with.

Let's investiage a bit on it. From right to left - we have a _IMAGE_VERSION_ here. It's an arbitrary
string and is up to you how that looks like. You can tag an image as
`docker tag <hash> <tag_name>:1.0` and later with new version of your app as `docker tag <hash> <tag_name>:1.1`.
But nobody checks or guarantees that the tag version `1.1` is somehow newer than the `1.0`.
There is a convention of version `latest`. That represents a *default version*
which is used when you don't define a version manually. I like this article
http://container-solutions.com/docker-latest-confusion[Docker: The latest Confusion]
which explains that `latest` is not related to _time_ but the meaning is rather _default_.

The _IMAGE_NAME_ is name of your app for you being able to differentiate and refer to it.

The _PROJECT_ and _REGISTRY_ is used to know where this image belongs to or where it comes from.
If you push or pull an image to the Docker registry you define where it is by this section of the tag definition.
There is no `docker` command line option _--registry=<REGISTRY>_. The information where to push to is taken from the tag.

== Docker build example

Let's say I have here a `Dockerfile` with env variables definition for Centos PostgreSQL image.

```dockerfile
FROM centos/postgresql-96-centos7

ENV POSTGRESQL_DATABASE crashrec
ENV POSTGRESQL_USER crashrec
ENV POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD crashrec
ENV POSTGRESQL_MAX_PREPARED_TRANSACTIONS 50
```

Running of `docker build .`, at the directory where the `Dockerfile` resides, provides output

```
Sending build context to Docker daemon 11.78 kB
Step 1/15 : FROM centos/postgresql-96-centos7
 ---> 75740e572487
Step 2/15 : ENV POSTGRESQL_DATABASE crashrec
 ---> Using cache
 ---> 3caf03ae8e7d
    ...
 ---> Using cache
 ---> 4188383000de

 Successfully built 4188383000de
```

I can take the image hash `4188383000de` and tag it with name. `docker tag 4188383000de postgresql-9.6-centos`.
By running `docker images` I can verify the assignment of the hash to the tag.

```
docker images
REPOSITORY               TAG       IMAGE ID        CREATED          SIZE
postgresql-9.6-centos    latest    4188383000de    9 minutes ago    337 MB
...
```

* The  listing uses terms _REPOSITORY_ and _TAG_ in way of I used here _name_ and _version_.
* I haven't defined any version but the image name was assigned with the _default_ `latest`.
* As there is not defined a registry (only name a.k.a  `${PROJECT}/${IMAGE_NAME}`) the image is search in the predefined registres (see _ADD_REGISTRY_ below). If found then it's downloaded. But you can download the image manually with `docker pull` and then as such named image already resides in the local cache it will be taken from there.

== Pushing image

The next step could be to mark the image with repository name and thus being able to push it there.
My account at http://dockerhub.com/[Docker hub] is https://hub.docker.com/r/ochaloup/. Thus my
regitry name to be used for being able to push there is `ochaloup`.

The tag then defines registry `docker.io` for `docker push` can publish the image there.

The whole name is then `docker.io/ochaloup/postgresql-9.6-centos`.

```bash
docker tag postgresql-9.6-centos docker.io/ochaloup/postgresql-9.6-centos
docker push docker.io/ochaloup/postgresql-9.6-centos
```

NOTE: maybe login to the docker.io will be needed first: `docker login docker.io -u ochaloup`

== Pulling image

If we want to run some image we can just run it

```
docker run --env POSTGRESQL_DATABASE=crashrec --env POSTGRESQL_USER=crashrec\
--env POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD=crashrec centos/postgresql-96-centos7`
```

We can say what is the repository we want the image from explicitly

```
docker run --env POSTGRESQL_DATABASE=crashrec --env POSTGRESQL_USER=crashrec\
--env POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD=crashrec  docker.io/centos/postgresql-96-centos7
```

Using the `docker.io` is not necessary because docker searches through all predefined registries if there is such
image. And the Docker hub is the default one where to search for the image.

You can see that I haven't used any `version` parameter thus the _default_ latest version was used.

Of course we could want https://hub.docker.com/r/centos/postgresql-94-centos7/tags/[some specific version] to be run

```
docker run --env POSTGRESQL_DATABASE=crashrec --env POSTGRESQL_USER=crashrec\
--env POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD=crashrec  docker.io/centos/postgresql-96-centos7:9.6
```

If we don't want to directly run the image but you want it to be downloaded to the local machine (to the https://thenewstack.io/understanding-the-docker-cache-for-faster-builds/[docker cache]),
you can use `docker pull` command. The following output says the image was already downloaded
as the `docker run` command was already run and it downloads first and then run the image.

```
docker pull centos/postgresql-96-centos7

Using default tag: latest
Trying to pull repository brew-pulp-docker01.web.prod.ext.phx2.redhat.com:8888/centos/postgresql-96-centos7 ...
Pulling repository brew-pulp-docker01.web.prod.ext.phx2.redhat.com:8888/centos/postgresql-96-centos7
Trying to pull repository docker.io/centos/postgresql-96-centos7 ...
sha256:88c5f8ffb934cc63f7eb819e3328c0380887c206fa6280c553a0a6385fa59e63: Pulling from docker.io/centos/postgresql-96-centos7
...
Status: Image is up to date for docker.io/centos/postgresql-96-centos7:latest
```

I can name it as e.g. `pgsl` like `docker tag docker.io/centos/postgresql-96-centos7 pgsl` and
run it `docker run pgsl ...` and I'm still starting the same image.

== Docker insecure registries

The list of repositories which are check for existence of the image (if not defined explicitly)
are hardcoded in docker config and can't be changed by a parameters.

If you want to pull image with the respository defined explicitly the repository needs to be running over `https`. If communication goes over `http` then `docker pull` fails.

In such case you need to add permition for docker to allow it to pull from that particular insecure registry.

=== Insecure registries set up

==== Configuration with RPM package docker

On my Fedora 26 when using rpm package `docker` I need to edit file `/etc/sysconfig/docker` and add such registry to
the list of `OPTIONS`. For example for the usage of Minishift private registry the `OPTIONS` parametr looks

```
OPTIONS='--selinux-enabled --log-driver=journald --insecure-registry docker-registry-default.192.168.99.100.nip.io:443'
```

You will need to `restart` docker after the change and you can pull from the non-https registry now.

==== Fedora 26 - registry and insecure registry patch

In case of Red Hat clone of the docker client you can use settings described in article
https://access.redhat.com/articles/1354823

In short you can use `ADD_REGISTRY` and `INSECURE_REGISTRY` variables in `/etc/sysconfig/docker`.
(_ADD_REGISTRY_ are registries search for the image when not defined explicitly by user)

```
echo "ADD_REGISTRY='--add-registry docker-registry-default.192.168.99.100.nip.io:443'" >> /etc/sysconfig/docker
echo "INSECURE_REGISTRY='--insecure-registry docker-registry-default.192.168.99.100.nip.io:443'" >> /etc/sysconfig/docker
```
This works for me on Fedora 26 when I have installed docker `package`.
A trouble with docker package for me came with some other images (e.g. for Oracle XE: https://hub.docker.com/r/wnameless/oracle-xe-11g[wnameless/oracle-xe-11g]
where issue https://github.com/wnameless/docker-oracle-xe-11g/issues/59 talks about troubles with `docker` package and `docker-ce` is needed to be used instead.

==== RPM docker-ce to be configured for insecure registries

Installation of `docker-ce` (replacing `docker`) is nicely introduced at guide https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/docker-ce/fedora/.

Now what about the registries config. I found nice description at: https://forums.docker.com/t/error-with-docker-pull-from-insecure-registry/31007/8

The `docker-ce` rpm pakcage has config at `/lib/systemd/system/docker.service`. After installation I needed to change and add lines

```bash
[Service]
Type=notify
EnvironmentFile=-/etc/sysconfig/docker
ExecStart=/usr/bin/dockerd $OPTIONS

# I have left the rest of the config file untouched
# ....
```

From that I redirected the configuration of the `OPTIONS` variable to file `/etc/sysconfig/docker` where I added my insecured registry just at a separate line like

```bash
OPTIONS='--insecure-registry default.192.168.99.100.nip.io:443'
```

[NOTE]
====
restart of the docker deamon is needed when the configuration files were changed

_if you do not run `daemon-reload` you will get message:
Warning: docker.service changed on disk. Run 'systemctl daemon-reload' to reload units._

```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart docker
```
====


==== Other OSes and docker registry configuration

*DISCLAIMER*: the following is untested

For the other OSes, you need to change probably the `/etc/docker/daemon.json` with

```json
{
  "registry-mirrors": ["docker-registry-default.192.168.99.100.nip.io:443"],
  "insecure-registries" :["docker-registry-default.192.168.99.100.nip.io:443"]
}
```
