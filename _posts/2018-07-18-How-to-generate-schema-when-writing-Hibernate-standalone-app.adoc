Recently I played with http://hibernate.org[Hibernate] as I need a really simple application that would be capable
to write and read data from the database while it would be portable for use with JDBC drivers
from different vendors. I didn't want to write an abstract
layer which would be dependent on particular JDBC driver and need to be recompiled with each.
I just wanted to add a driver on the classpath, change a property and let it run.
No recompilation.
And it's what the Hibernate solved for me at the end.

On top of that, I wanted Hibernate to create the database schema. Mine is pretty simple
thus the entity could be scanned and created based on its attributes.

More precisely what I wanted

* a standalone java application
* code being independent on specific JDBC driver
* generating database schema independently on specific SQL syntax. Normally the `CREATE`
  the command could differ database from the database.
* being able to influence database name before starting of the java application
  (e.g. by some descriptor or system property)
* saving and querying data to/from the database

== Two possible solution with the Hibernate

While elaborating with Hibernate I found two way how to achieve my goal.

The first way was using JPA with `persistence.xml` definition of database connection properties
and entity used as schema. Then asking https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/persistence/package-summary.html[javax.persistence.Persistence]
to generate the schema.

The second was using Hibernate API programmatically creating
https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-orm/blob/master/hibernate-core/src/main/java/org/hibernate/boot/registry/StandardServiceRegistryBuilder.java[service registry builder]
and using https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-orm/blob/master/hibernate-core/src/main/java/org/hibernate/tool/hbm2ddl/SchemaExport.java[schema exporter]
to generate the schema.

The demand for dynamically changing the table name was done by implementing
https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/5.2/javadocs/org/hibernate/boot/model/naming/PhysicalNamingStrategy.html[naming strategy]
that adding a suffix to the original table name. This approach was taken in both
cases. In one the strategy to be used as defined in the `persistence.xml` and using property
`hibernate.physical_naming_strategy` while in the second case the strategy was provided
to the `MetadataBuilder`.

=== Running the code example

I played with the both approaches
under the project https://github.com/ochaloup/hibernate-standalone.

If you want to run the example you need to

. get the repo `git clone https://github.com/ochaloup/hibernate-standalone`
  (use the correct branch to work with either `jpa-and-xml` or `hibernate-programatic-approach`)
. package it (maven is configured to create fat jar containing hibernate library): `mvn clean package`
. get the JDBC driver (expected you will use the PostgreSQL one: https://jdbc.postgresql.org)
. run PostgreSQL database (you can use docker to run it:
  `docker run -p 5432:5432 --rm  -ePOSTGRES_USER=test -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=test postgres:9.4 -c max-prepared-transactions=110 -c log-statement=all`)
. start the java program at root `cd hibernate-standalone`
.. `java -cp target/hibernate-standalone-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar:<./postgresql-driver.jar>:. cz.chalda.Main`

[NOTE]
====
You can watch names of all tables at PostgreSQL with query

```
SELECT *  FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_type = 'BASE TABLE'
  AND table_schema = 'public' ORDER BY table_type, table_name;
```

== JPA persistence.xml approach

This approach could be investigated at the branch
https://github.com/ochaloup/hibernate-standalone/tree/jpa-and-xml.

The all connection configuration is defined in the
https://github.com/ochaloup/hibernate-standalone/blob/jpa-and-xml/src/main/resources/META-INF/persistence.xml[`persistence.xml`] file.
Here we define connection properties for the database, the dialect which defines how to query for the JDBC driver
and there is a defined table naming strategy if needed.

The example then uses the descriptor file `hibernate.hbm.xml` which defines `<entity-mapping>` attribute.
This configuration file is placed in the root of the project and is referred in the `persistence.xml`
with the absolute path of `./`. That means when running `java -cp ... <program-name>` the program
will expect the mapping file at the place the java is run at.\+
That's why the mapping file is placed at the root and defines different table name for you too
(up to the fact of the existence of the naming strategy).

For interest, the example contains the mapping file
https://github.com/ochaloup/hibernate-standalone/blob/jpa-and-xml/src/main/resources/META-INF/hibernate.hbm.xml.out[hibernate.hbm.xml.out]
containing the whole mapping of the entity but with table name redefinition.

The logic of creating the database schema and the entity save and the load is hidden in the class
https://github.com/ochaloup/hibernate-standalone/blob/jpa-and-xml/src/main/java/cz/chalda/Main.java[cz.chalda.Main].
There you can see the usage of `javax.persistence.Persistence` to generate the database schema
and then to get the `PersistenceUnit` for being able to save and load the entity.


== Programmatic hibernate approach

This approach could be investigated at the branch
https://github.com/ochaloup/hibernate-standalone/tree/hibernate-programatic-approach.

There is no configuration files in this case. We configure all at
https://github.com/ochaloup/hibernate-standalone/blob/hibernate-programatic-approach/src/main/java/cz/chalda/Main.java[cz.chalda.Main] file.

The connection is configured via `StandardServiceRegistryBuilder` and it is defined
credentials and the dialect too.
Next is the usage of the `MetadataBuilder` class which offers registration for enhancement of the
`PhysicalNamingStrategyStandard` to change table name with suffix.
The last part is using `SchemaExport` for database schema creation
while metadata is used again for getting `SessionFactory` and `Session`
for being able to create and update the database data.

== Summary

Thanks for attention.

Both approaches offer a way to run a standalone java app with Hibernate
to save time to develop an integration layer to different JDBC drivers
while showing some Hibernate extension points to be used for further application tuning.
