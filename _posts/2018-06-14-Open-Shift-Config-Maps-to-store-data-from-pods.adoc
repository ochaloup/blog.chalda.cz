If you search for information about `ConfigMap` in https://www.openshift.com[OpenShift] or https://kubernetes.io[Kubernetes]
then you find it's a mechanism to abstract your application from configuration.
`ConfigMap` is then way to define configuration values (usually in form of a `yaml` file)
while the configuration is then injected to the running application which can utilize
the information as it likes.

There is not many information that the `ConfigMap` primitives can be used
from inside of the pod (and from the application itself) to persist data
which is then available via OpenShift API calls.

_see more details about OpenShift API calls at article http://blog.chalda.cz/2018/02/28/Querying-Open-Shift-API.html_

[NOTE]
====
As the first step is good to scan the documentation pages from
https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.2/dev_guide/configmaps.html[OpenShift]
or https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-pod-configmap[Kubernetes]
to get overview of the usage.
====

== ConfigMap creation

To create a simple ConfigMap object let's use the `oc` command while naming the
it `special-config` and filling it with two keys (`special.how`, `special.type`)
and matched values.

```bash
$ oc create configmap special-config --from-literal=special.how=very --from-literal=special.type=charm
```

We can use the `oc create` to get the `ConfigMap` being created from json data format.

```bash
cat <<EOF | oc create -f -
{
  "kind": "ConfigMap",
  "apiVersion": "v1",
  "metadata": {
      "name": "special-config"
   }
}
EOF
```

When using the `oc` command we can utilize argument `describe` to find
the content of just created ConfigMap `special-config`.

```bash
$ oc describe cm special-config

Name:         special-config
Namespace:    myproject
Labels:       <none>
Annotations:  <none>

Data
====
special.how:
----
very
special.type:
----
charm
Events:  <none
```

To get the same information by querying OpenShift API we will call

```bash
ENDPOINT=$(minishift ip):8443
TOKEN=$(oc whoami -t)
NAMESPACE=$(oc project -q)
CONFIG_MAP_NAME=special-config

curl -k -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H 'Accept: application/json'\
  https://$ENDPOINT/api/v1/namespaces/$NAMESPACE/configmaps/$CONFIG_MAP_NAME
```

The output will be similar to this

[source,json]
----
{
  "kind": "ConfigMap",
  "apiVersion": "v1",
  "metadata": {
    "name": "special-config",
    "namespace": "myproject",
    "selfLink": "/api/v1/namespaces/myproject/configmaps/special-config",
    ...
  },
  "data": {
    "special.how": "very",
    "special.type": "charm"
  }
}
----

== Making changes in the ConfigMap

As said we can not only query `ConfigMap` data but we can write them too.
Here we use the `PUT` operation wile we re-write all data saved in the `special-config`
`ConfigMap` and replace them with data from `json` we're providing.

```bash
curl -k -X PUT -d @- -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H 'Accept: application/json'\
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'\
  https://$ENDPOINT/api/v1/namespaces/$NAMESPACE/configmaps/$CONFIG_MAP_NAME <<'EOF'
{
"kind": "ConfigMap",
"apiVersion": "v1",
"metadata": {
    "name": "special-config"
 },
 "data": {
    "Samwise": "Gamgee",
    "Rosie": "Cotton"
 }
}
EOF
```

This is good but what if we don't want just override the content of the existing
`ConfigMap` but we would like to add new data or change the value of a single existing key.

Here we got to the point to find out there are strategies that could be used
while working with the `ConfigMaps`. We can patch the existing `ConfigMaps`
by, surprisingly, calling with method `PATH` and defining `Content-Type`.
We can use either merge strategy `application/merge-patch+json` or patch
strategy `application/json-patch+json`. For the summary of the approaches I like
article at http://erosb.github.io/post/json-patch-vs-merge-patch.

With `merge-patch` we use `PATCH` with json format (as we used with `PUT` above)
and the `ConfigMap` will be merged (instead of replaced).

```bash
curl -k -X PATCH -d @- -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H 'Accept: application/json'\
  -H 'Content-Type: application/merge-patch+json'\
  https://$ENDPOINT/api/v1/namespaces/$NAMESPACE/configmaps/$CONFIG_MAP_NAME <<EOF
{
  "kind": "ConfigMap",
  "apiVersion": "v1",
  "metadata": {
      "name": "special-config"
   },
   "data": {
      "Rosie": "Gamgee"
   }
}
EOF
```

After executing this the patch the data will look like

```json
"data": {
  "Rosie": "Gamgee",
  "Samwise": "Gamgee"
}
```

With the `json-patch` is needed to define what is operation to be processed
over the particular key. Let's make the value removal while changing the other one.

```bash
curl -k -X PATCH -d @- -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H 'Accept: application/json'\
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json-patch+json'\
  https://$ENDPOINT/api/v1/namespaces/$NAMESPACE/configmaps/$CONFIG_MAP_NAME <<EOF
[
  {
    "op": "replace",
    "path": "/data/Samwise",
    "value": "Baggins"
  },
  {
    "op": "remove",
    "path": "/data/Rosie"
  }
]
EOF
```

== Authorization

For you can update the `ConfigMap` from inside of the pod, the service account
the pod is running at has to be permitted to do changes in the `ConfigMap`.
You should create a new service account with such permissions and configure
your pod to run with that service account. Here is an example of the configuration
json which defines a new service account and declares it to be of role `edit`
which provides permissions to make changes (to edit) most of the things in the
current namespace (project). Of course you can define permissions
http://blog.chalda.cz/2018/02/28/Querying-Open-Shift-API.html#_permisions_to_the_openshift_objects[in more granular way].

For importing it you can use `oc create -f <path-to-file-with-this-json>` and then
applying imported template by `oc new-app --template=role-testing`.

```json
{
    "kind": "Template",
    "apiVersion": "v1",
    "metadata": {
        "name": "role-testing"
    },
    "parameters": [
        {
            "displayName": "Application name",
            "name": "APPLICATION_NAME",
            "value": "myproject",
            "required": true
        }
    ],
    "objects": [
        {
            "apiVersion": "v1",
            "kind": "ServiceAccount",
            "metadata": {
                "name": "${APPLICATION_NAME}-sa"
            }
        },
        {
          "kind": "ConfigMap",
          "apiVersion": "v1",
          "metadata": {
              "name": "special-config"
           },
          "data": {}
        },
        {
            "apiVersion": "v1",
            "kind": "RoleBinding",
            "metadata": {
                "name": "${APPLICATION_NAME}-role-binding"
            },
            "subjects": [
                {
                    "kind": "ServiceAccount",
                    "name": "${APPLICATION_NAME}-sa"
                }
            ],
            "roleRef": {
                "kind": "Role",
                "name": "edit"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
