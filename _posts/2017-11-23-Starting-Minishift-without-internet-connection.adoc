The https://github.com/minishift/minishift[Minishift] is an tool which provides an easy way to run https://www.openshift.org[OpenShift] locally on developer's machine. Minishift uses an hypervisor to start a virtual machine where the whole OpenShift environment is set up. Thus you can start, stop and delete the whole environment in seconds.

For the easy resolution of Minishift addresses there is used DNS http://nip.io (http://xip.io times before) which translate the DNS query to address mentioned befor the `nip.io` suffix.

```bash
host 127.0.0.7.nip.io
127.0.0.7.nip.io has address 127.0.0.7
```

If you create an OpenShift route in Minishift it uses the `nip.io` for translation.

```bash
```
