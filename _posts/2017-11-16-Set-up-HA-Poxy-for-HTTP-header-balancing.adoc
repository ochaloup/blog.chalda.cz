I started to experiment with https://www.haproxy.org/[HAProxy] where these are few notes on how to start with.

I wanted to have HAProxy as a standalone program and not installed into my Linux machine with package system. Thus

* download HAProxy from https://www.haproxy.org, I used downloading _bz2_ archive from column _Latest version_.
* `tar xfz haproxy-*.tar.gz`
* `cd haproxy-*/`
* `make TARGET=generic`

At this time the HAProxy is built and could be run. For the start it's `./haproxy -- config-file.cfg`. (start with ones situated at folder `tests`).

For experimenting I downloaded WildFly 11 (http://wildfly.org/downloads), started in two instances and deployed a simple servlet showing simple message of what instance handled the request.

```bash
curl http://download.jboss.org/wildfly/11.0.0.Final/wildfly-11.0.0.Final.zip -o wfly.zip
unzip wfly.zip && mv wildfly-11.0.0.Final w1
unzip wfly.zip && mv wildfly-11.0.0.Final w2

# running in two different consoles
cd w1 && ./bin/standalone.sh -Did=w1
cd w2 && ./bin/standalone.sh -Did=w2 -Djboss.socket.binding.port-offset=100

# in the third console
git clone https://github.com/ochaloup/servlet-test.git
cd servlet-test && mvn package
cp target/servlet-test.war ${HOME}/w1/standalone/deployments/
cp target/servlet-test.war ${HOME}/w2/standalone/deployments/
```

Now we have two instances of WildFly application servers running at `http://localhost:8080` and `http://localhost:8180`. You can check if the servlet deployed sucessfully

```bash
curl -i -X GET http://localhost:8080/servlet-test/host
```

You should get response containing header and text

```
X-processed-by: w1
...
url: http://localhost:8080/servlet-test/host at localhost:8080, 10.0.0.7, <hostname>
```

Let's run the haproxy and check roundrobin loadbalancing. Go to the HAProxy installation directory and open `tests/test-connection.cfg`. Add to the `server` directive one more with port `8181`. You will have something similar to.

```
listen httpclose
	option	httpclose
	bind	:8001
	server	srv 127.0.0.1:8080
	server	srv2 127.0.0.1:8180
	reqadd	X-request:\ mode=httpclose
	rspadd	X-response:\ mode=httpclose
```

Let's start the HAProxy and check with `curl`

```
./haproxy -- tests/test-connection.cfg 
```

and check with `curl`. Run several times and check how the header `X-processed-by` is changing plus you can see WildFly console log in the particular console window.

```
curl -i -X GET  http://localhost:8001/servlet-test/host
```

Now let's balance by url parameter. You need to redefine file `tests/test-url-hash.cfg` to contain the localhost and both ports where WildFly is running. Then you can run `curl` and alter the foo parameter and see what is the WildFly instance handling the requests.

```bash
./haproxy -- tests/test-url-hash.cfg 

curl -i -X GET localhost:8000/servlet-test/host?foo=one
curl -i -X GET localhost:8000/servlet-test/host?foo=thousands
```
