<p>What is this about?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>&#8230;&#8203;just another blog where you can find notes from somebody&#8217;s work programming life.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And that&#8217;s it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is still a motivation for doing that, sure. Few reasons, solely selfish <span class="icon"><i class="fa fa-smile-o"></i></span></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First one is showing that I like what I&#8217;m doing and this passion could potentialy help somebody.
The kick of for me thinking about such thing was
<a href="https://vimeo.com/99516367">presentation Jurgen Appelo at GeeCon 2014</a>. I watched several
other presentations from Jurgen afterwards but this one somehow influenced my thinking.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The second is my infinite fight with recording knowledge. I usualy read something and
I forget what that thing was about after few weeks. If not used in short period of time then
it goes to <code>/dev/null</code> black hole.
I found out that putting down few notes summarized in my own words helps me
in this endeavour. Plus it works as kind of time machine to get back in time
to understand what I was thinking to understand <span class="icon"><i class="fa fa-smile-o"></i></span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Yeap, the only trouble is that writing such notes take a good amount of time.
But mostly it&#8217;s worthy.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then writing in English to enhance my skills.
Hmm&#8230;&#8203; I still hope that it could that be readable.</p>
