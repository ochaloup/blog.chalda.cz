On working with Solana, I regularly need to check the contents of a transaction or an account.
Usually, data reading is done through a user interface, eliminating the need for manual intervention.
However, there are situations where using the UI is not possible or convenient, or when one simply wants to verify the presence of certain data manually.
In this article, I will share a method I use for this purpose, and along the way, we will explore some tools that can be helpful.

NOTE: As a disclaimer, there are certainly other ways to accomplish this task. I would be glad to learn more,
      so feel free to share with me on Twitter at https://twitter.com/_chalda[_chalda^].

== Solana Transaction and Account Data

A brief touch on Solana transactions and accounts first (no details, there are many other resources for that).
For the purpose of this article, we say that Solana has an https://solanacookbook.com/core-concepts/accounts.html#account-model[account^] with various attributes (such as `owner` and possession of `lamports`), and the account's content is represented as raw binary data, with the structure defined by the owning program. Similarly, transactions have a https://solanacookbook.com/core-concepts/transactions.html#facts[specific format^] that dictates the accounts involved in the transaction, while the call data is encoded solely according to the owning program's requirements.

== Solana CLI to fetch data

To investigate, let's get some data from blockchain.

Through of this article I use an example contract program called https://github.com/ochaloup/simple-admin/tree/v1[simple-admin^] (branch `v1`).
It's a simple program allowing to create an admin account and, once created,
one can request to print a message that's included in the transaction's log.
The program is deployed at the devnet address https://explorer.solana.com/address/sa3HiPEaDZk5JyU1CCmmRbcWnBc9U4TzHq42RWVUNQS?cluster=devnet[`sa3HiPEaDZk5JyU1CCmmRbcWnBc9U4TzHq42RWVUNQS`^].

We are gonna use `solana account` command to fetch data of accounts created with the `simple-admin` program.
We executed instruction https://github.com/ochaloup/simple-admin/blob/v1/programs/simple-admin/src/instructions/create_simple_account.rs[`CreateSimpleAccount`^] that initialized Solana account at devnet address
https://explorer.solana.com/address/DabBrrPf3JcNgKqcYNhn3tVcfPwDpsQ6HdAifNWi1ebJ?cluster=devnet[`DabBrrPf3JcNgKqcYNhn3tVcfPwDpsQ6HdAifNWi1ebJ`^].
By default, the `solana account` command displays the data in hexadecimal format.
However, by using the `--output` option, we can retrieve the data in `base64` format, that we want to use here.

[source,sh]
----
# DabBrrPf3JcNgKqcYNhn3tVcfPwDpsQ6HdAifNWi1ebJ is an administrative account of the simple-admin contract
solana -ud account DabBrrPf3JcNgKqcYNhn3tVcfPwDpsQ6HdAifNWi1ebJ --output json
----


[source,json]
.--output json
----
{
  "pubkey": "DabBrrPf3JcNgKqcYNhn3tVcfPwDpsQ6HdAifNWi1ebJ",
  "account": {
    "lamports": 1224960,
    "data": [
      "pZvg+dv0TqnyG8J8NTj5iMEN0Cv0IG7X57+QlCAJzwcIXnvdhqAXFQMAAAAAAAAA",
      "base64"
    ],
    "owner": "sa3HiPEaDZk5JyU1CCmmRbcWnBc9U4TzHq42RWVUNQS",
    "executable": false,
    "rentEpoch": 0
  }
}
----

Similarly, we can fetch data about a transaction.

For this example, I have selected one of the transactions that interacts with the `simple-admin` program.
It's a transaction containing the instruction https://github.com/ochaloup/simple-admin/blob/v1/programs/simple-admin/src/instructions/print_admin.rs[`PrintAdmin`^] that takes a message and prints it to transaction log.
By using the `solana confirm` command with the `-v` switch, we obtain all the data from the transaction
(without the `-v` switch, only the transaction state confirmation is displayed).
Additionally, when we include the `--output json` option, the data is provided in `base58` format.

[source,sh]
----
# transaction of simple-admin contract calling PrintAdmin instruction
solana confirm -ud 55E5mPX87Ms55chvKdGUg2XCGrJ1Qp4Pw7ER4z4fCgSqtXQ3JhZGXP7mpohTxPEm8S87Q5PNW7x7MSqx9GDATMiF --output json -v

== Converting Data to a Uint8 Array

When working with data, I find helpful to examine its content in the form of a `uint8` binary data array.
In this format, bytes are represented as unsigned integers. You may recognize this format if you've ever printed
the content of a private key file, such as one generated using the command
`solana-keygen new --silent --no-bip39-passphrase --outfile /tmp/random.keypair; cat /tmp/random.keypair`.

To simplify the process of converting data, I've created some handy Python scripts.
These scripts allow you to easily transfer data from one source to another.
You can find the scripts in my gist here:

These scripts are designed to streamline the conversion process.
Feel free to explore and utilize them for your own data conversion needs.

[NOTE]
====
When working with account data, instead of using the `solana account --output` argument,
you have the option to use `--output-file /path/to/file`.
This allows you to save the account data directly into a file in binary form.

One way to work with this binary data in uint8 array shape is by utilizing the `od` command in Bash.
Here's an example of how you can use it:

[source,sh]
----
# loading data from binary format as u8 array
decimal_array=($(od -An -t u1 < '/path/to/file'))
# printing data
echo "${decimal_array[@]}"

# printing only last 32 bytes of the loaded data
echo "${decimal_array[@]:(-32):32}"

== Data Interpretation

The `simple-admin` program is written with Anchor and we have the benefit of knowing that the data is encoded
with https://borsh.io[borsh] here.
As well we know that Anchor uses first `8 bytes` of the data
for the https://docs.rs/anchor-lang/latest/anchor_lang/trait.Discriminator.html[discriminator^]
(sha256 hash of the account's Rust identifier).

We have the https://github.com/ochaloup/simple-admin/[contract source code^] at hand.
The data structure of the
https://github.com/ochaloup/simple-admin/blob/v1/programs/simple-admin/src/state/simple_account.rs[`SimpleAccount`^]
is declaratively defined in the code. We can see that it includes
https://docs.rs/solana-program/latest/solana_program/pubkey/struct.Pubkey.html[a `Pubkey` field^],
which we could know having the length of 32 bytes, and a `u64` number with a length of 8 bytes.

By examining this code, we can gain insights into the structure of the data and understand the specific lengths.

<<simple-account>>
[source,rust]
----
pub struct SimpleAccount {
    pub admin: Pubkey,
    pub print_call_count: u64,
}
----

With call of `solana account` CLI command above we've got `base64` formatted data. Let's decode it to uint array
with the use of the scripts above.

[source,sh]
----
solana -ud account DabBrrPf3JcNgKqcYNhn3tVcfPwDpsQ6HdAifNWi1ebJ --output json

# ... taking account data base64 string ...
frombase64.py pZvg+dv0TqnyG8J8NTj5iMEN0Cv0IG7X57+QlCAJzwcIXnvdhqAXFQMAAAAAAAAA

----

We observe that the array comprises `48`` bytes. The initial `8` bytes represent the Anchor descriptor,
followed by `32`` bytes denoting the `Pubkey`, and the remaining `8` bytes represent a numerical value.
Notably, this number is encoded as an unsigned integer (`uint`), with Solana utilizing Little Endian encoding.

# > [3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
# printing the 8 bytes as integer

----

Up until this point, we have overlooked the initial `8` bytes, which serve as the Anchor discriminator (`[165, 155, 224, 249, 219, 244, 78, 169]`). 
This value, a hash of the account name, can be regarded as internal Anchor details. However, if we wish to verify that we are operating with the correct account, as Anchor utilizes the discriminator to confirm the integrity of the loaded data, we can obtain an expanded version of the sources by utilizing the `anchor expand` CLI command
when we have access to the source code.

[[anchor expand discriminator]]

----
git clone https://github.com/ochaloup/simple-admin.git -b v1

=== Transaction data structure

For the transaction output of the `solana confirm` command we can read quite a good context
from the `logMessages` that often shows the `Instruction name` and informs what happens.
But let's take a look only on the base info and the call data here.
We can see there is used one instruction and we can check more about accounts as well.

When examining the transaction output of the `solana confirm` command, we can extract valuable information from the `logMessages`. 
The log messages often provide insightful details, such as the `Instruction name` 
However, for our current purpose, let's focus solely on `call data`.
We can observe that a single instruction was utilized, and we can delve deeper into the involved accounts.

NOTE: to learn about the transaction format
      I recommend deep dive article link:https://medium.com/@asmiller1989/solana-transactions-in-depth-1f7f7fe06ac2[Solana transactions in depth^]

# >        }
# >      ]
# > ...
----

Let's examine the data in the same format of `uint8` array as we did for an account above.

[source,sh]
----
frombase58.py 7oAbCvAjeJqUZ7RpVyY51x5Sa
# > [163,217,65,81,53,230,29,28,6,0,0,0,104,101,108,108,111,51]
----

[[anchor transaction discriminator]]
We are aware that the Anchor program employs the first `8 bytes` as a discriminator,
indicated here as `[163, 217, 65, 81, 53, 230, 29, 28]`.
Unlike Ethereum, Solana follows a single entrypoint approach for programs. In this paradigm, the program itself assumes the responsibility of determining which operation or function should be executed.
This is where the discriminator plays a crucial role. These `8 bytes` serve as a defining factor,
allowing the deployed program to select the appropriate function for execution.
The Anchor discriminator is calculated as a hash from the source from the
https://solana.stackexchange.com/a/4996/1386[name of the operation^]
https://solana.stackexchange.com/a/3185/1386[/function^].

As we have the source code of the program we can use again
the <<anchor expand discriminator, `anchor expand`>> command to find out that the operation
that will be executed.

[source,rust]
----
cd simple-admin
vim .anchor/expanded-macros/simple-admin/simple-admin-*.rs

impl anchor_lang::Discriminator for PrintAdmin {
    const DISCRIMINATOR: [u8; 8] = [163, 217, 65, 81, 53, 230, 29, 28];
}
----

Now, let's examine the accounts that are involved. From the output of the <<PrintAdmin instruction output, `solana confirm`>> call it appears that the account at index `3` is used as the program address,
while accounts at indexes `2` and `1`, in that particular order, are considered as instruction input accounts.
From inspecting the `accountKeys` the keys are indexed starting from `0`.
It's worth noting that the public key at index `0` is responsible for paying the transaction fee, i.e., it's the `feePayer`.
By examining the values, we can determine that `sa3HiPEaDZk5JyU1CCmmRbcWnBc9U4TzHq42RWVUNQS`
corresponds to the program ID, and the two accounts provided are
`DabBrrPf3JcNgKqcYNhn3tVcfPwDpsQ6HdAifNWi1ebJ` and `HJ6DPqQhAYRw8YyEuVXV8mwzzNAexxEYVC3aQutWxWn8`, listed in that order.

With the code at hand we can examine the `PrintAdmin` instruction
https://github.com/ochaloup/simple-admin/blob/main/programs/simple-admin/src/instructions/print_admin.rs[source code^].

[source,rust]
----
pub struct PrintAdmin<'info> {
    pub simple_admin_account: Account<'info, SimpleAccount>,
    pub admin: Signer<'info>,
}

pub fn process(&mut self, PrintAdminParams { message }: PrintAdminParams) -> Result<()> {
  // ...
}
----

We can read that the first account address passed in the instruction, the `DabBrrPf3JcNgKqcYNhn3tVcfPwDpsQ6HdAifNWi1ebJ`, is used as storage data account (`pub simple_admin_account: Account<'info, SimpleAccount>`).
 The second account address `HJ6DPqQhAYRw8YyEuVXV8mwzzNAexxEYVC3aQutWxWn8`
is the `admin` wallet address and we recognize that this key has to sign the transaction.
Only when the transaction is signed by this key the processing is allowed (` pub admin: Signer<'info>`).

Now what about the `call data`? We already know that the first `8` bytes is <<anchor transaction discriminator,the discriminator of the operation>>.
The rest is a message
https://github.com/ochaloup/simple-admin/blob/v1/programs/simple-admin/src/instructions/print_admin.rs#L15[`PrintAdminParams#message`^].
The message is a `string`. As it's Solana Rust We know it will be the UTF-8 string.
In assistance of the python scripts we can get the `message` in a readable form.

[source,sh]
----
solana confirm -ud 55E5mPX87Ms55chvKdGUg2XCGrJ1Qp4Pw7ER4z4fCgSqtXQ3JhZGXP7mpohTxPEm8S87Q5PNW7x7MSqx9GDATMiF --output json -v

toout.py [6,0,0,0,104,101,108,108,111,51] string
# > hello3
----

And we can see that the transaction log should contain the message `hello3` (i.e., `msg!(...)` Solana Rust macro).
Let's confirm it in the transaction listing.

[source,sh]
----
# get info about the examined transaction
solana confirm -ud 55E5mPX87Ms55chvKdGUg2XCGrJ1Qp4Pw7ER4z4fCgSqtXQ3JhZGXP7mpohTxPEm8S87Q5PNW7x7MSqx9GDATMiF --output json -v

----

NOTE: We previously mentioned that we have access to the source code. But how to know 
      where the code can be found at? This is why it's considered good practice to include the
      https://github.com/neodyme-labs/solana-security-txt[`security-txt`] metadata within your program.
      https://blog.chalda.cz/posts/solana-anchor-verifiable-builds#_bonus_solana_security_txt[By publishing it],
      you can enhance the security and transparency of your program.
      Once the metadata is published, you can conveniently locate your program using
      https://explorer.solana.com/address/sa3HiPEaDZk5JyU1CCmmRbcWnBc9U4TzHq42RWVUNQS/security?cluster=devnet[the Solana Explorer^].
      This makes it easier to access and review the relevant information.


== Data interpretation: Looking at non-Anchor program accounts

Since there are no strict guidelines for data formatting within Solana accounts,
the Borsh encoding is not the only option available. Another commonly used strategy for encoding binary data in Solana accounts is through the use of link:https://docs.rs/bincode/latest/bincode/[bincode^].
Bincode is frequently utilized within the Solana program library. A good example of this can be seen in the
 https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/v1.14.17/runtime/src/inline_spl_token.rs#LL11C16-L11C30[SPL Token program^].

To further illustrate, let's perform a quick check. We will create a new mint and mint a token to the ATA wallet address that we will examine.

[source,sh]
----

NOTE: Native Solana programs often use `bincode` library (within `serde`) to get the data coded.
      The `borsh` and `bincode` base64 data formats are not fully compatible but they could be transferred.
      Recently I started https://github.com/coral-xyz/anchor/pull/2486#issuecomment-1549469516[a discussion at Anchor project^]
      where the maintainer https://twitter.com/acheroncrypto[acheroncrypto^] managed the coding

=== RPC call getProgramAccounts

In the case of our test program, "SimpleAdmin," let's search for all admin accounts (`SimpleAccount`) that have been executed three times. To achieve this, we need to search for Solana accounts that are owned by the "simple-admin" program deployed at devnet at `sa3HiPEaDZk5JyU1CCmmRbcWnBc9U4TzHq42RWVUNQS` where it has got data of
https://github.com/ochaloup/simple-admin/blob/v1/programs/simple-admin/src/state/simple_account.rs#L7[`print_call_count`^] field equal to `3`.

To accomplish this, we will make a call to the https://solana.com/rpc[devnet RPC server^] (assuming we have already created an account instance there). For this example, we only need to determine the number of accounts that meet the criteria (`print_call_count` equal to `3`). We do not need to download the entire program data. Hence, we set the `dataSize` parameter to `0`.

Based on the provided filter criteria, we know that the data for each "SimpleAccount" consists of `8` bytes for the Anchor discriminator, followed by `32` bytes for the public key, and finally `8` bytes for the counter we want to match. The offset value we use is `40` (calculated as 8 + 32). To specify the data to match, we pass the `base58` format of the byte array `[3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]` (`u64`), which is represented as `W723RTUpoZ`.

You can check another example of setting up the filters of the
the Solana RPC HTTP call https://docs.solana.com/api/http#getprogramaccounts[getProgramAccounts^]

== Tooling

=== Borsh account decoding

We talked about a potential way how to examine manually binary data structure of the Solana accounts and transactions call data.
Despite it's handy to check the account this way in general it's tedious and unproductive.
Toolings around Solana makes this just easier.

When we talk about the `borsh` formatted accounts (which are mostly those written in Anchor)
there is a site https://borsh.m2.xyz to help.
It helps to decode the account when we understand its structure.
Similar as we did above manually with `python/bash` scripts we can just click through
this web. Here is example for examined
https://borsh.m2.xyz[DabBrrPf3JcNgKqcYNhn3tVcfPwDpsQ6HdAifNWi1ebJ^] account.
We fill-in the field types and size and offset is calculated for us.

=== UI for transactions

A user-friendly tool for constructing transactions can be found at https://bettercallsol.dev/.
This tool allows you to easily create transactions by interacting with various parameters through a graphical interface.
Once you have defined the transaction, you have the option to run it, simulate it, or pass it to integrated systems for further processing. For more detailed information, you can refer to the blog post titled
https://blog.labeleven.dev/solana-transactions-with-better-call-sol[Solana Transactions with Better Call Sol^].

In the context of this article, I attempted to define a transaction for the "Simple Admin" contract, specifically for the "PrintAdmin" operation. You can view the form and its parameters in the accompanying screenshot.

image::articles/decoding-solana-data/better-call-sol.png[alt=better call sol,width=500]

=== Anchor IDL

The most versatile approach is to have an IDL definition that can be interpreted by tooling, providing us with a dynamic understanding of the underlying binary structure. This allows us to gain insights into account names and interpret transactions and accounts within blockchain explorers. The aforementioned UI tool also utilizes IDL to offer information about account names.

When developing a program using the Anchor framework, the IDL is automatically generated. However, for non-Anchor programs, the https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/solita[Solita^] framework provided by the Metaplex Foundation can be utilized.
There is an ongoing discussion about establishing a standardized way for IDL in Solana
https://forum.solana.com/t/srfc-00008-idl-standard/66/2[on the Solana forum^].

For the benefit of Anchor IDL data interpretation, the program
https://blog.chalda.cz/posts/solana-anchor-verifiable-builds#_uploading_anchor_idl[has to be published with IDL on chain^].
When one does it it can be seen in https://explorer.solana.com/ down in the box `Anchor Program IDL`.

image::articles/decoding-solana-data/explorer-solana-idl-box-only.png

For our examined `Simple Admin` contract the IDL
can be seen https://explorer.solana.com/address/sa3HiPEaDZk5JyU1CCmmRbcWnBc9U4TzHq42RWVUNQS/anchor-program?cluster=devnet[in the Explorer^] and the Typescript format is published next to the contract
https://github.com/ochaloup/simple-admin/blob/v1/packages/simple-admin-sdk/generated/simple_admin.ts[at GitHub^].

The Explorer makes it easy to access transaction details in a human-readable format.
For example, you can observe the transaction with the id https://explorer.solana.com/tx/55E5mPX87Ms55chvKdGUg2XCGrJ1Qp4Pw7ER4z4fCgSqtXQ3JhZGXP7mpohTxPEm8S87Q5PNW7x7MSqx9GDATMiF?cluster=devnet[55E5mPX87Ms55chvKdGUg2XCGrJ1Qp4Pw7ER4z4fCgSqtXQ3JhZGXP7mpohTxPEm8S87Q5PNW7x7MSqx9GDATMiF^] or the

Other Solana blockchain inspectors knows to interpret IDL data in the similar way.
You can see the similar at https://solana.fm/address/DabBrrPf3JcNgKqcYNhn3tVcfPwDpsQ6HdAifNWi1ebJ/anchor-account?cluster=devnet-solana[Solana.fm^] for example.

== Conclusion

We discussed one way how to manually examine the Solana data structures in binary format.
For that purpose we used Python and Bash scripts.
We also discussed the tooling that can help us.
