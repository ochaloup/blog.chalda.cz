A tale of an ordinary developer who receives a task, and during the process, he learns various things.
This story revolves around Solana multisig configured with SPL Governance, 
and the creation of an arbitrary transaction that multisig members sign and execute.

== SPL Governance as multisig manager

The https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/governance/[SPL Governance] is a Solana program that runs DAO management.
One https://app.realms.today/realms[can create] his own DAO instance in the system and use the SPL Governance for community to manage the DAO.
But another possible usage is to use it as a multisig tooling. For that one creates a new DAO where no community is involved and only particular wallets
has permission to proceed with signatures. This is referred as council managed.
There are other offerings for multisig management like https://squads.so/[Squads protocol].
While a benefit of the https://twitter.com/realms_daos[SPL Governance] system is that's part of
the Solana Program Library and thus it's developed by people from https://solanalabs.com[Solana Labs].

This is simple as go to https://app.realms.today/ (when testing the your configuration add https://app.realms.today/?cluster=devnet[?cluster=devnet] for devnet deployment),
click at blue button `Create DAO` and choose the `Multi-Signature Wallet`. The wizard goes with you through few steps
where one defines what wallet keys will be part of the multisig management (members of the multisig may be still
https://docs.realms.today/DAO-Management/DAO-add-members[added or removed later])
and then the multisig DAO is created.

NOTE: For technical details about the SPL Governance system I recommend to read through the
      https://docs.realms.today/spl-governance-deep-dive[SPL Governance Deep Dive] article.

For the purpose of the showcase in this blog post I have created a DAO
https://app.realms.today/dao/2EogxMvrtTr8ccA4oQcAGfS8vKbDhYTANA12LW3fqUy3?cluster=devnet[Solana multisig signature]
https://app.realms.today/dao/2EogxMvrtTr8ccA4oQcAGfS8vKbDhYTANA12LW3fqUy3/members?cluster=devnet[with one member]
of address `FwkjePeCG5CjD8uYsHh3hvj6X26KnNh2UrpZSpDiNbfh``.

After the multisig DAO is created we can start to provide a transactions that should be signed by the multisig members.
Any actions that the multisig should sign have to be defined as a `Proposal`
that contains transactions. When the proposal is confirmed by multisig members then anybody may be execute.
At the main page of the DAO one click at `âŠ• New Proposal`. When the member wallet is connected a new `Proposal` can be created and then multisig owners
can vote for or against it. The SPL Governance system provides a list of common `Instruction`s types that is integrated to UI and easily set up.
Those are things as sending funds or working with https://spl.solana.com/token[token accounts].
But what if my custom contract contains some admin abilities that I need to manage?
How can I create a transaction that contains an arbitrary data?

=== SPL Governance workflow

Before we talk about custom transactions for SPL Governance let's briefly discuss the `Proposal` workflow
in the SPL Governance system. The `Proposal` is a unit that represents "an action" to be processed.
The "action" is constituted as a transaction that can be executed when acknowledged by all multisig members.

The SPL Governance `Proposal` workflow is first to create a `Proposal` with one or several instructions.
Multisig members votes for the proposal. When the defined threshold of votes is exceeded then
the instructions that constitute the `Proposal` can be executed. The threshold is defined as percentage
per a `Governance` that represent the multisig wallet address.
This fact is important from the perspective
of the multisig signature and administering the admin rights in the contract. It's the `Governance Wallet` address
that needs to be defined as owner of the funds to be transferred or and administrator authority within your contract.
It's the `Governance Wallet` address that the SPL Governance uses to sign the transactions on behalf
of the acknowledgment of the multisig members.

The `Governance` configures not only the threshold but also the time of the `Proposal` voting.
When the time exceeds the `Proposal` and not enough `Yes` votes were collected,
then the proposal is considered as failed and can't be voted anymore.

Either, if the `Proposal` succeeds or not when finished can be `Finalized`
and `parked` at the final state for the SPL system recognizing it as a finished matter.

=== SPL Governance Custom Transaction

For anybody can create a `Proposal` with whatever transaction content there is Instruction type `Common: Execute Custom Instruction`.
The transaction can be created with UI for anybody having the keys for the council power
at the address of the DAO https://app.realms.today/dao/2EogxMvrtTr8ccA4oQcAGfS8vKbDhYTANA12LW3fqUy3/proposal/new?cluster=devnet

The field `Governance` defines the multisig signature key that the transaction will be signed with.
`Hold up time (days)` can be defined with 0 if we don't want to delayed the instruction execution after `Proposal` acknowledgment.
The `Instruction` field has to be filled with `Base64 encoded serialized Solana instruction`...

But wait, where to get it?

Basically, this can be whatever transaction that is encoded to `base64` of borsh(!) serialized data
that contains `program id`, `account keys` and `call data`

[source,typescript]
----
[
  InstructionData,
  {
    kind: 'struct',
    fields: [
      ['programId', 'pubkey'],
      ['accounts', [AccountMetaData]],
      ['data', ['u8']],
    ],
  }
]
----

When we work with Typescript we can use the https://github.com/solana-labs/oyster[Oyster] SPL Governance SDK
that provides the function
https://github.com/solana-labs/oyster/blob/040b7c89f757846f64c2436dbb58ecc4db8c5837/packages/governance-sdk/src/governance/serialisation.ts#L229[`serializeInstructionToBase64`]
that takes an instruction and provides the encoded form
that can be copy-pasted into the field.

If we work with Rust we need to transform the `Transaction` structure in the required format and print it.
When using `bincode` then one can use the way provided in Anchor CLI in function
https://github.com/coral-xyz/anchor/blob/v0.28.0/cli/src/lib.rs#L2247[print_idl_instruction]
(included as part of the PR https://github.com/coral-xyz/anchor/pull/2486/files#diff-c1f8f7498da827a634bddc8a7559198bc99b296e9d9e8b91a70b503662995b8cR2248[CLI anchor idl command to use dump base64 for set-buffer and close])
or in case of usage `serde` then prepare the `struct` that align with the expected format. It could be for example as of struct
https://github.com/marinade-finance/multisig/blob/master/programs/multisig/src/lib.rs#L239[TransactionInstruction]
that implements https://github.com/marinade-finance/multisig/blob/master/programs/multisig/src/lib.rs#L263[From for Instruction]
and can be used like https://github.com/coral-xyz/anchor/pull/2486/commits/ff4d9f9a1c4fb875b5ac0d772d99fa97d01b5208#diff-c1f8f7498da827a634bddc8a7559198bc99b296e9d9e8b91a70b503662995b8cR2068[base64::encode(ix.into().try_to_vec()?)]. 

== Contract example with admin authority

To show the deployment I use a simple example contract https://github.com/ochaloup/simple-admin/tree/v2[`Simple admin`]
under `v2` branch (the first version of the contract https://github.com/ochaloup/simple-admin/tree/v2[`v1`]
was used as example in the article link:./decoding-solana-data[Decoding Solana data accounts]).

The contract works on the simple base where admin has to sign the
https://github.com/ochaloup/simple-admin/blob/v2/programs/simple-admin/src/instructions/print_message.rs[`PrintMessage`]
instruction. When signed then instruction is successfully executed which prints message
into the transaction log and saves it into a separate solana account.
The created admin account https://explorer.solana.com/address/3oZa6pjVpC5m1gaKYnXWoxahrBQt2dCsapBSiDAMBWoh/anchor-account?cluster=devnet[`3oZa6pjVpC5m1gaKYnXWoxahrBQt2dCsapBSiDAMBWoh`] configures the admin being
the multisig governance wallet https://app.realms.today/dao/2EogxMvrtTr8ccA4oQcAGfS8vKbDhYTANA12LW3fqUy3/treasury/v2?cluster=devnet[`GjYBMcRv4JzkgqCfeUKQMs7KygkFvgLpGzFbQ7SihGJ8`].

With that the `PrintMessage` instruction has to be signed with SPL governance `Proposal` acknowledged by members of the multisig.
Obviously the Governance UI does list the `simple-admin` instructions in the listing
and we need to provide the base64 encoded transaction by ourselves.
The `simple-admin` contract provides a CLI command for that purpose. It can generate the base64 format of the `PrintMessage` transaction.

First, let's re-check what's setup within the contract.

[source,sh]
----
git clone https://github.com/ochaloup/simple-admin -b v2
cd simple-admin

pnpm install
# check content of the simple account
pnpm cli -ud show -a 3oZa6pjVpC5m1gaKYnXWoxahrBQt2dCsapBSiDAMBWoh
----

[source,json]
----
{
  programId: 'sa4ihCaRZKuYZtY4fcdnNqx9vx9Lc6KELrL2nBkzNn2',
  data: [
    {
      publicKey: '3oZa6pjVpC5m1gaKYnXWoxahrBQt2dCsapBSiDAMBWoh',
      admin: 'GjYBMcRv4JzkgqCfeUKQMs7KygkFvgLpGzFbQ7SihGJ8',
      printCallCount: '0',
      createdAccountNextIndex: 0
    }
  ]
}
----

The content of the `simple-account` says that only signature of the governance wallet
`GjYBMcRv4JzkgqCfeUKQMs7KygkFvgLpGzFbQ7SihGJ8` permits to execute the operation.
When we try to execute the transaction signed by the default wallet (`~/.config/solana/id.json`)
an error is emitted.

[source,sh]
----
# trying to execute the print-message with default solana wallet
pnpm cli -ud print-message  --message 'gm gm' 3oZa6pjVpC5m1gaKYnXWoxahrBQt2dCsapBSiDAMBWoh
> [...] ERROR (377647): Admin CUuLjSEx7q3AB3sRGn3sMJBsSNTmULwowMGUh6NdsxQD is not an admin of simple account 3oZa6pjVpC5m1gaKYnXWoxahrBQt2dCsapBSiDAMBWoh > (admin is GjYBMcRv4JzkgqCfeUKQMs7KygkFvgLpGzFbQ7SihGJ8)
----

That's not what we want and thus we follow the the original plan to use the governance wallet signature.

[source,sh]
----
# get base64 transaction data to be used as custom transaction
pnpm cli -ud print-message --print-only --rent-payer GjYBMcRv4JzkgqCfeUKQMs7KygkFvgLpGzFbQ7SihGJ8 --admin GjYBMcRv4JzkgqCfeUKQMs7KygkFvgLpGzFbQ7SihGJ8 --message 'gm gm' 3oZa6pjVpC5m1gaKYnXWoxahrBQt2dCsapBSiDAMBWoh

> [...] INFO (377533): Message 'gm gm' successfully printed for account 3oZa6pjVpC5m1gaKYnXWoxahrBQt2dCsapBSiDAMBWoh
----

Let's elaborate on this action a little bit.

We used the `--print-only` argument that instead of execution of the transaction to cluster
uses the Oyster function to print the transaction in base64 format.
// TODO: add link to code here

An important thing to notice is that we provided the `--rent-payer` argument.
The `PrintMessage` instruction creates a new account where a message is saved into.
The account has to be created with deposit of the rent exempt that has to be payed by somebody.
For that we need the CLI provides a way to pass a pubkey here.
We generated base64 transaction data which is not signed, neither there is a blockhash encoded.
The signatures are added at time of the execution. The SPL Governance UI uses the wallet signature
provided by the user that clicks button `Execute` in browser. The browser wallet is used to pay the transaction fee.
That's an obligatory part. This signature can be used for any other purposes as well, for example for rent payment.
If we create the base64 transaction with rent payer pubkey of a wallet
then only that particular wallet is then able to execute transactions from the acknowledged `Proposal`.
As rent payer we used again the address of the governance wallet. We pre-funded the governance wallet
with some SOLs beforehand. As the SPL Governance system provides the transaction execution
always with the signature of the governance wallet the pre-funded SOLs can be used for example
as payment for the rent.

With instruction prepared in base64 format we can create a `Proposal` of custom transaction of this content.

image::articles/spl-custom-transaction/multisig-proposal-creation.png[]

Before we create the `Proposal` with the transaction we can check the if transaction
content is correct and can be run. With using `Preview Transaction` button the transaction will be simulated.

image::articles/spl-custom-transaction/multisig-proposal-creation-simulation.png[]

The `Inspect` button redirects us to Solana Explorer
where we can review the transaction from there.

// TODO: talk about Solana TX tool


When we finish with having the `Proposal` created, the `Proposal` is acknowledged by multisig members
(the more that threshold of voters voted `Yes` on the `Proposal`) and 
the `Proposal` transaction was executed, then a print-account is created
with content of a message.
The `simple-admin` CLI allows us to list all print-accounts belonging
to a particular simple-admin account.

[source,sh]
----
pnpm cli -ud show --address 3oZa6pjVpC5m1gaKYnXWoxahrBQt2dCsapBSiDAMBWoh --print-address
----

[source,json]
----
{
  programId: 'sa4ihCaRZKuYZtY4fcdnNqx9vx9Lc6KELrL2nBkzNn2',
  data: [
    {
      publicKey: 'BERXDKKk7xmArJXHxDdb9rRqLdd7TRsGXJyh6tj9ZTit',
      simpleAccount: '3oZa6pjVpC5m1gaKYnXWoxahrBQt2dCsapBSiDAMBWoh',
      message: 'gm gm'
    }
  ]
}
----

== Summary

With that we went through the SPL Governance Multisig signature management,
we talked about `Proposal` creation and risk connected with Proposal's transaction
using signatures different to a wallet (fee-payer) and we introduced
a tool to list SPL Gov
