If one creates a program for Solana blockchain using Anchor framework,
it's recommended to
https://lorisleiva.com/create-a-solana-dapp-from-scratch/deploying-to-devnet[publish]
it as https://www.anchor-lang.com/docs/verifiable-builds[verifiable build].
You can find out that that's easy as to run `anchor build --verifiable`
while there is not much else to find about.

NOTE: This article is based on the Anchor version 0.27.0.

== Why to do so?

When the verifiable build is deployed to the Solana network, it's possible to
check that the program binary is the same as the declared one.
One can checkout the source code of the program at particular commit
and run `anchor verify` against it. Immediately it's possible to see
if the binary matches the checked-out code and if no change was done to the program.

For one can do the verification the deployed program has to be
one created as a verifiable build, otherwise the `anchor verify` command fails.

== What is a verifiable build?

A verifiable build is a build of the program done within a clean pre-defined
environment, in this case a Docker container.
The default docker image is https://hub.docker.com/r/projectserum/build/tags[`project-serum/anchor`]
(configured at https://github.com/coral-xyz/anchor/blob/v0.27.0/cli/src/config.rs#L370[anchor cli]).
One can use a different image by setting the CLI option `-d, --docker-image <DOCKER_IMAGE>`.

When the `anchor build --verifiable` is run, the docker image is pulled from docker hub
and the build is done inside.
As this is a clean environment the build process requires to download all the dependencies, do compilation
and it takes some time. The result of the build is standard `.so` binary file
which is stored at `./target/verifiable/`. The build generates also the IDLs
which are stored at `./target/idl/` and `./target/types`.

The compiled binary can be then published to network but I haven't found a way how to do it
with `anchor deploy`. So I'm using the `solana` CLI tool to do it.

[source,shell]
----
solana program deploy -v -u devnet --keypair ~/.config/solana/devnet.json \
  --program-id <PROGRAM_ID> \
  --program-authority <PATH_TO_KEYPAIR> \
  ./target/verifiable/program.so
----

NOTE: usually `<PROGRAM_ID>` is defined at https://github.com/marinade-finance/liquid-staking-program/blob/447f9607a8c755cac7ad63223febf047142c6c8f/Anchor.toml#L9[`Anchor.toml`]

== Uploading Anchor IDL

When the program is deployed, the Anchor IDL
https://lorisleiva.com/create-a-solana-dapp-from-scratch/deploying-to-devnet#bonus-publish-your-idl[has to be published]
as well otherwise the verification of the build will fail.
To upload the IDL use the one created by the verifiable build process.

[source,shell]
----
 anchor idl init --provider.cluster devnet \
   --filepath ./target/idl/program.json \
   <PROGRAM_ID>
----

When the IDL has been uploaded once the further update of the account can be done with `upgrade` subcommand
`anchor idl upgrade ...`.
The permission to do the IDL upgrade is defined by the idl authority.

[source,shell]
----
anchor idl authority --provider.cluster devnet <PROGRAM_ID>

# one can change the idl account authority
anchor idl set-authority --provider.cluster devnet \
  --program-id <PROGRAM_ID> \
  --new-authority <AUTHORITY_PUBKEY>
----

== Verifying the build

To verify the build one runs the `anchor verify` command. The command runs again inside the docker image,
it builds the program, generates the IDL and compares the result with the one deployed to the network.

First one needs to checkout the source code of the program at the commit which was used for the build.
Then one runs the `anchor verify` command.

[source,shell]
----
# git checkout
git clone <GIT_REPOSITORY>
git checkout <COMMIT_HASH>

# anchor verify
anchor --provider.cluster devnet verify \
  -p <PROGRAM_NAME> <PROGRAM_ID>
----

`<PROGRAM_NAME>` is the name of library defined at https://github.com/marinade-finance/liquid-staking-program/blob/447f9607a8c755cac7ad63223febf047142c6c8f/programs/marinade-finance/Cargo.toml#L9[`Cargo.toml`] file. Usually the repository uses the hyphenated name while the library name is with underscores.
If the name directory structure name is e.g., `programs/marinade-finance` then the <PROGRAM_NAME> is most probably `marinade_finance`.

`<PROGRAM_ID>` is the address of the program deployed at blockchain, in our case the one deployed at devnet.

== Two additional points

It's nice that the verification cannot be done only against the deployed program but also against
https://medium.com/coinmonks/solana-internals-part-2-how-is-a-solana-deployed-and-upgraded-d0ae52601b99[the buffer].
When one writes binary to buffer the buffer content could be verified.

[source,shell]
----
# write the program to buffer (-ud is shortcut for devnet cluster)
solana -ud program write-buffer ./target/verifiable/program.so
# buffer authority can be changed in case (not needed for verification)
solana -ud program -um set-buffer-authority \
  --new-buffer-authority <AUTHORITY_PUBKEY> <BUFFER_ID>
# verify the buffer
anchor --provider.cluster devnet verify -p <PROGRAM_NAME> <BUFFER_ID>
----

The second point is that the verifiable build and verification can be done also
with non-anchor programs. We used this with
https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/README.md[SPL Governance]
and it worked well. As the IDL is not generated there is no check for the IDL and it works without it.

[source,shell]
----
# get source code
git clone https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library -b governance-v3.1.0
cd solana-program-library/governance/program
# do the build
anchor build --verifiable
# deploy the program
cd ../..
solana -um -k ~/.config/solana/devnet.json program write-buffer ./target/verifiable/spl_governance.so
# later the program can be upgraded from buffer to <PROGRAM_ID>

# verify the build
anchor --provider.cluster mainnet verify -p spl_governance <PROGRAM_ID>
----

== A docker issue

Unfortunately I was not able to create verifiable build with `anchor build --verify` command on my machine.
The only result I got was the error message

----
ERROR (5963): ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/root/.config/solana/id.json'
----

I found the reason was some anchor version mismatch.
I solved that by using newer version of the docker image
`projectserum/build:v0.27.0`.
Or in case to use own docker image based on the `projectserum/build` image
from https://github.com/ochaloup/projectserum-build-docker
(needed to be build locally first).

With running `anchor build --verifiable -d projectserum/build:v0.27.0`
the error message was gone and the build was successful.

== BONUS: solana-security-txt

For an usual contract it's a good practice providing metadata about the program.
Besides others there could be a link to source code, info about audit and how to contact the author.
This is useful not only to security researchers.

The Neodyme labs comes with a Rust library defining a macro
https://github.com/neodyme-labs/solana-security-txt[`solana-security-txt`]
inspired by https://securitytxt.org[security.txt] standard.

The program creator adds Rust dependency `solana-security-txt = "1.1.0"` to the `Cargo.toml` file
and then adds the metadata into the library source code https://github.com/marinade-finance/solana-program-library/commit/93d808aac6a69c253edc3cddc6e15f5a2c81be24[with macro definition `security_txt!`]. A simple example cound be

[source,rust]
----
/// solana-security-txt for admin contract
use solana_security_txt::security_txt;
security_txt! {
    name: "Simple admin contract",
    project_url: "https://github.com/ochaloup/simple-admin",
    contacts: "twitter: @_chalda",
    policy: "",
    preferred_languages: "en, cz",
    source_code: "https://github.com/ochaloup/simple-admin",
    auditors: "None"
}
----

The format, required fields and other details are described at the library
https://github.com/neodyme-labs/solana-security-txt#format[README].

The good part is that this standard is integrated within
https://explorer.solana.com/address/GovMaiHfpVPw8BAM1mbdzgmSZYDw2tdP32J2fapoQoYs?cluster=devnet[the Solana explorer]
and one can
https://explorer.solana.com/address/GovMaiHfpVPw8BAM1mbdzgmSZYDw2tdP32J2fapoQoYs/security?cluster=devnet[check the content easily].

== Conclusion

The verifiable build allows to verify the program binary against the source code. It's a recommended way for publishing the program
to Solana blockchain.
