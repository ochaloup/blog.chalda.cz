For this blog I've been using the link:posts/hubpress-io-how-to-install[Hubpress.io]
&mdash; nice blog theme, online wysiwyg asciidoc editing with github automatic deployment.
Unfortunately is not developed for some time already and I wanted to switch to something.
It was https://www.gatsbyjs.com[Gatsby] that caught my interest.
I'm not a frontend developer but I wanted to check what's about that https://reactjs.org[React] and https://jamstack.org/[JAM stack] thing.

I started with searching https://jamstackthemes.dev/ssg/gatsby/[the Gatsby themes] and looking for a blog one.
I wanted one that supports link:posts/asciidoctor[Asciidoc]
but 99.9% of themes work only with the https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax[Markdown].
The rest 0.1% are rather showcases than themes.
I decided to go for https://github.com/alxshelepenok/gatsby-starter-lumen[Gatsby Starter Lumen]
and make adjustments by hand.

== Learning Gatsby

First I needed a bit understand the Gatsby project.
After reading few _getting started_ posts I found the best was to go through was this tutorial
https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/build-a-developer-blog-from-scratch-with-gatsby-and-mdx[How to Build Your Coding Blog From Scratch Using Gatsby and MDX].
It's a little older and not all details work perfectly
but it is a really great way to understand the structure.
It elaborates on details of content processing, graphql queries, styling and others things.

Petty soon I understood that Gatsby works with set of plugins where one of them manages the `md` files.
The tutorial uses the
https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-mdx[gatsby-plugin-mdx].
While the _Gatsby Starter Lumen_ works with with
https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-transformer-remark[gatsby-transformer-remark].
I.e., there are different Markdown plugins of the same prupose in the ecosystem.

The _"good news"_ is that there is only one Asciidoc plugin available as
https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-transformer-asciidoc[gatsby-transformer-asciidoc].
The fine thing is that the `gatsby-transformer-asciidoc`
is pretty similar to `gatsby-transformer-remark` used by _Lumen Starter_ project.

While working on the tutorial I aimed to get working `.adoc` transformation in parallel with `.mdx` ones.

The repository that contains my work is at
https://github.com/ochaloup/gatsby-from-scratch.

NOTE: I haven't finished whole tutorial as I wrapped it up in middle of the text when MDX plugin stopped
      working for me. Later I found it's because
      of https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/discussions/34714#discussioncomment-2108962[some Gatsby changes].

=== Gatsby structure

Let's briefly recap about the Gatsby project structure.

==== A JavaScript project

As non-javascript developer I want to start with few things around the JS projects in general.

* dependencies are defined in `package.json`
* JS world uses many package managers - default `npm`, better `yarn`, newer a and faster `pnpm`
  (I chose `yarn`)
* `yarn install` downloads `js` dependencies and places them under `$PWD/node_modules`
* when dependencies are installed a `lock` files (`yarn.lock`, `package-lock.json`) are created.
  They ensures the same versions of the libraries are used when building subsequently on other environments.
  They are https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44552348/should-i-commit-yarn-lock-and-package-lock-json-files[recommended to be pushed to github].
* when working with TypeScript the configuration file is `tsconfig.json`. It configures how the transpiler
  built the final `js` file.
* `package.json` contains section `"scripts"` that defines automation of different commands.
  Any defined `script` command may be executed with `npm run <command>` or `yarn <command>`.

==== A Gatsby project

Now a bit about the Gatsby itself.

The good way is to click through the structure of
https://github.com/alxshelepenok/gatsby-starter-lumen/[the Lumen Starter directory structure]
or https://github.com/spences10/thelocalhost/tree/blog-post-code[the tutorial project].
It may not contain all but it sheds light on the parts.

image::articles/gatsby-font-title.jpg["Illustrative image of art deco Gatsby font"]

* The configuration file is `gatsby-config.[js,ts]`. It defines global properties and configures gatsby plugins.
* Any plugin needs to be declared as dependency in `package.json` as well.
* The configuration file `gatsby-node.js` defines hooks that are executed on startup of nodejs.
  It's a way to setup dynamic pages where we want to list a set of options, like categories or tags are.
* The `gatsby-browser.js` sets up the behaviour for browsers (e.g. SCSS files).
* The `content/config.js` is used by _Lumen theme_ to get some basic config of site (e.g., title).

Besides the configuration files there is the directory structure (details
https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/gatsby-project-structure/[at the Gatsby documentation]).

The Gatsby is a React application thus the directory structure consists of _Gatsby specific parts_
and the directories _comming from React_.

* `public/` is not to be touched. it's automatically generated and it contains output of the build process (part of `.gitignore`)
* `static/` contains data that are copied to `public/` as they are. used for placing image files etc.
* `content/` is not a standard Gatsby directory but it's usually used by the plguins (`md`, `adoc`). it's configured at
   https://github.com/alxshelepenok/gatsby-starter-lumen/blob/3a6dbc17ca00ad4ccc84e82a840b59c3824ab709/gatsby-config.ts#L20[gatsby-config.ts]
* `src/` directory contains code
** `src/pages/` contains pages that's are generated directly at the path (e.g., it's a place for `index.js`)
** `src/templates` templates used in programatically build pages
** `src/compontents` react directory, contains react components that can be used within `templates`
** `src/hooks/` react directory, hooks that can be invoked from components retrieving data, &hellip;
** `src/utils/` react directory, utilities
** `src/types/` react directory, for typescript types definitions

image::articles/gatsby-font-line.jpg["A decorator line", height=30]

The gatsby provides command line tool `gatsby` to generate the content (`gatsby build`)
and to help with development (`gatsby develop`).
If it's installed with `yarn` we could have configured
https://github.com/ochaloup/gatsby-from-scratch/blob/main/hello-world/package.json#L8[the `script`]
that works from `node_modules`.

On starting with _Lumen Starter_

[source,sh]
----
# getting the code to be adjusted
git clone https://github.com/alxshelepenok/gatsby-starter-lumen
cd gatsby-starter-lumen
# installing dependencies under node_modules
yarn install
# starting developmer mode
yarn start
----

The Lumen is started at localhost in dev mode.
The site can be accessed at http://localhost:8000
(graphql at http://localhost:8000/___graphql).

=== React GraphQL and Gatsby

All data that Gatsby works with comes through the GraphQL processing (i.e., React).
The Markdown and Asciidoc plugins processes the documents and the results are consumed with GraphQL queries.
Components queries _title_, _tags_, _generated HTML_ etc. That data is places to pages dependent on the visual demands.

The most of the work for met on moving from Markdown to Asciidoc was the remapping of the Markdown GraphQL queries that the _Lumen Starter_ uses and to change them for Asciidoc.

My work with tutorial tried to work with `adoc` and `md` data (MDX plugin is used) side by side.
You can see e.g., here https://github.com/ochaloup/gatsby-from-scratch/blob/main/hello-world/src/pages/index.js#L40

[source,graphql]
----
query SITE_INDEX_QUERY {
  allMdx(
    sort: { fields: [frontmatter___date], order: DESC }
    filter: { frontmatter: { published: { eq: true } } }
  ) {
    nodes {
      id
      excerpt(pruneLength: 250)
      frontmatter {
        title
        date
      }
      fields {
        slug
      }
    }
  }
  allAsciidoc(
    sort: { fields: [revision___date], order: DESC }
    filter: { pageAttributes: { published: { eq: "true" } } }
  ) {
    nodes {
      id
      document {
        title
      }
      pageAttributes {
        synopsis
      }
      revision {
        date
      }
      fields {
        slug
      }
    }
  }
}
----

That query could be investigated in GraphQL console (http://localhost:8000/___graphql).
The data generated by both plugins are structured in a bit different form
that comes for example from fact that Asciidoc works with a pre-defined
https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/document/header/[header metadata]
while Markdown with no specific spec here.

Both plugins retrieves data from the `{ nodes }` where the `node` represents one `md`/`adoc` document.

Then the MDX plugin offers excerp which is a plane text of the article and then
metadata is represented at header in key/value form.
The https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ochaloup/gatsby-from-scratch/main/hello-world/posts/2022/2022-10-01-first-post/index.mdx[example document]
is below.

[source,mdx]
----
---
title: Hello World - from mdx!
date: 2022-10-01
published: true
category: "Markdown Pro"
tags:
  - "One"
---

# h1 Heading

My first post!!
----

The result data of the GraphQL query for the document returns

[source,json]
----
{
  "data": {
    "allMdx": {
      "nodes": [
        {
          "id": "e7b45c55-eed2-5ed4-a59d-68ae03e208cf",
          "excerpt": "My first post!!",
          "frontmatter": {
            "title": "Hello World - from mdx!",
            "date": "2022-10-01T00:00:00.000Z"
          },
          "fields": {
            "slug": "/2022/2022-10-01-first-post/"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
----

while and example of the Asciidoc document has a predefined header to be used
and does not provide a plane text of the article. We need to use synopsis field
to be specifially filled with text.
The
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ochaloup/gatsby-from-scratch/main/hello-world/posts/2022/2022-10-08-a-test/index.adoc[example document]
is below.

[source,adoc]
----

The GraphQL response for the document is

    "allAsciidoc": {
      "nodes": [
        {

=== Gatsby Lumen Starter changes for Asciidoc to work

==== Markdown to Asciidoc: Plugins

I changed the
https://github.com/alxshelepenok/gatsby-starter-lumen/blob/fa2bac05139875408fe9f36bba59289ada3d3d6e/gatsby-config.ts#L92[Markdown plugin `gatsby-transformer-remark`]
for
https://github.com/ochaloup/blog.chalda.cz/blob/efdec3c4e5b84a9ed0ff35c4f6c72b9ca4e5e242/gatsby-config.ts#L95[Asciidoc plugin `gatsby-transformer-asciidoc`].

That change requires to delete other Mardown/remark plugins from configuration
as `gatsby-remark-images` (better image handling), `gatsby-remark-responsive-iframe` (iframe wrapped to responsive elastic containe),
`gatsby-remark-autolink-headers` (github style links hover effect), `gatsby-remark-prismjs` (code block syntax highlighting),
`gatsby-remark-copy-linked-files` (copying local files linked in `md` to the `public/` directory),
gatsby-remark-smartypants` (Replaces "dumb" punctuation marks), `gatsby-remark-external-links` (adds the target and rel attributes to external links).

With using Asciidoc I needed to abandon that functionality (or add it differently when needed).
That's pity but I just wanted the asciidoc syntax a lot!


==== Markdown to Asciidoc: GraphQL

The next step was to change all the GraphQL queries from Markdown structure to Asciidoc one.
It's quite similar while a bit different in details.
What's the worse was a fact that Markdown header properties is capable to work with a list
while asciidoc consider all header properties as a string. I need to do quite a boring manual
parsing of e.g., tags.

The GraphQL queries are all over the code so it was quite boresome work. The good thing was there are tests (`yarn test`)
that helped me to undrestand what I forgot to cover. An example of such difference of the query is covered above
or you can check github

* `md` remark plugin : https://github.com/alxshelepenok/gatsby-starter-lumen/blob/fa2bac05139875408fe9f36bba59289ada3d3d6e/src/hooks/use-categories-list.ts#L12
* `adoc` asciidoc plugin : https://github.com/ochaloup/blog.chalda.cz/blob/efdec3c4e5b84a9ed0ff35c4f6c72b9ca4e5e242/src/hooks/use-categories-list.ts#L12

Then there was still the trouble with metadata format. The Markdown may work with _"a list"_
while the Asciidoc works only with _strings_.
Check
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alxshelepenok/gatsby-starter-lumen/fa2bac05139875408fe9f36bba59289ada3d3d6e/content/posts/2016-01-09---Perfecting-the-Art-of-Perfection/index.md[how tags are defined in `md`] like

[source,md]
----
tags:
  - "Handwriting"
  - "Learning to write"
----

The tags in https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ochaloup/blog.chalda.cz/efdec3c4e5b84a9ed0ff35c4f6c72b9ca4e5e242/content/posts/2017-05-06-DNS-setting-for-GitHub-pages.adoc[Asciidoc is like]

[source,adoc]
----
:page-tags: Handwriting, Learning to write
----

While in `md` is fine to do https://github.com/alxshelepenok/gatsby-starter-lumen/blob/fa2bac05139875408fe9f36bba59289ada3d3d6e/src/hooks/use-tags-list.ts#L12[just aggregate the list with the graphql query] to get "the tag name" and "the number of occurences"

[source,graphl]
----
...
group(field: frontmatter___tags) {
  fieldValue
  totalCount
}
...
----

in case of `asciidoc` it's needed to get all data, parse it and group it in typescript afterwards. See my way here:
* get all data: https://github.com/ochaloup/blog.chalda.cz/blob/efdec3c4e5b84a9ed0ff35c4f6c72b9ca4e5e242/src/hooks/use-tags-list.ts#L14
* parse and group to get `totalCount`: https://github.com/ochaloup/blog.chalda.cz/blob/efdec3c4e5b84a9ed0ff35c4f6c72b9ca4e5e242/src/utils/group-tags.ts#L11


==== Markdown to Asciidoc: Image paths

The remark consists of plugin `gatsby-remark-copy-linked-files` that checks what are files used in `md` file
and then it copies them to `public/` directory where the static generated result page is placed.
If you check the _Starter Lumen_ it places pictures within the folder of the article
like https://github.com/alxshelepenok/gatsby-starter-lumen/tree/fa2bac05139875408fe9f36bba59289ada3d3d6e/content/posts/2016-01-12---The-Origins-of-Social-Stationery-Lettering/media[`content/posts/<post-name>/media`].
The same directory structure is copied to `public/`.

That's not the case for asciidoc as there is no such plugin. I didn't want to create one
and I just decided to place manually the pictures (and other) data to `public/` folder.
The `gatsby-transformer-asciidoc` can be configured to add _a prefix` to any image path
https://github.com/ochaloup/blog.chalda.cz/blob/efdec3c4e5b84a9ed0ff35c4f6c72b9ca4e5e242/gatsby-config.ts#L99[with `imagesdir`].
The images are placed under `static/images/` but the asciidoc refers it only
https://github.com/ochaloup/blog.chalda.cz/tree/efdec3c4e5b84a9ed0ff35c4f6c72b9ca4e5e242/static/images/articles[as `image::articles/some-image.png`]
when linked
https://github.com/ochaloup/blog.chalda.cz/blame/efdec3c4e5b84a9ed0ff35c4f6c72b9ca4e5e242/content/posts/2017-05-17-asciidoctor.adoc#L18[from the `adoc` file].


==== Markdown to Asciidoc: Syntax highlighting

One of the things I really want to work is syntax highlighting.
The plugin `gatsby-remark-prismjs` was removed and I needed to add that somehow manually.

I did it with direct use of the `highlight.js` library.
I needed to create utility that runs the
https://highlightjs.org/usage/[`hljs.highlightAll()`]
that's in https://github.com/ochaloup/blog.chalda.cz/blob/efdec3c4e5b84a9ed0ff35c4f6c72b9ca4e5e242/src/utils/highlightCode.ts[highlightCode.ts].
The `hightlight.js` was added to
https://github.com/ochaloup/blog.chalda.cz/blob/efdec3c4e5b84a9ed0ff35c4f6c72b9ca4e5e242/package.json#L70[`package.json`]
and then the utility used as effect
https://github.com/ochaloup/blog.chalda.cz/blob/efdec3c4e5b84a9ed0ff35c4f6c72b9ca4e5e242/src/components/Post/Post.tsx#L27[in template of posts].


==== Markdown to Asciidoc: CSS Style changes

This part is not finished and not examined well for me. I needed to add some styling that I feel better about
and I did it in different places just to get it working.

The base was adding some asciidoctor styles that I borrowed from github of
https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-stylesheet-factory/tree/main/sass[asciidoctor-stylesheet-factory].
I integrated it within the sass rules of the Lumen at
https://github.com/ochaloup/blog.chalda.cz/tree/efdec3c4e5b84a9ed0ff35c4f6c72b9ca4e5e242/src/assets/scss/asciidoctor[`src/assets/scss`].

The other part was that I used CSS from the Hubpress.io Ghostium theme
https://github.com/ochaloup/blog.chalda.cz/blob/gh-pages/themes/ghostium/assets/css/asciidoctor-default.css[asciidoctor-default.css].

Combined together while did some comments at some component configuration as well gets it more or less working.

=== Gatsby blog deploy to Github pages

I used my prior article of link:dns-settings-of-github-pages[Github pages setup].
The deploy is done via Github actions that's configured at Github under `Settings -> Pages`

image::articles/gatsby-github-pages.png["Github pages deploy screen"]

The script is generated by Github but it could be adjusted.
When confirmed in Github the actions is saved into yaml file at `.github/workflows` folder.
You can check configuration, with slight change, of my tutorial project at
https://github.com/ochaloup/gatsby-from-scratch/blob/main/.github/workflows/pages.yml[.github/workflows/pages.yaml].
