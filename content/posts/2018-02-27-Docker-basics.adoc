There are many articles on how to start and use docker. This one is a meant rather as
my personal (hopefully complementary) notes.

See these nice articles for example:

* http://blog.codepipes.com/containers/docker-for-java-big-picture.html
* https://zeroturnaround.com/rebellabs/docker-for-java-developers-how-to-sandbox-your-app-in-a-clean-environment

== How to install: Fedora 26

Installing docker on Fedora is straight forward by running `dnf install docker`

NOTE: in some cases I have got troubles with Fedora docker package - for example
when starting Oracle XE image from https://github.com/wnameless/docker-oracle-xe-11g.
I haven't solved that by anything else than installing competing `docker-ce`. See how to install at
https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/fedora/.
My changes of the Oracle XA image can be seen at https://github.com/ochaloup/dockerfiles-test/tree/master/oraclexe-wnameless

Installed `docker` client does not permit to start containers by ordinary user, only by root.
For the user `chalda` being able to start the container I need to create a docker group

```bash
# under account 'chalda'
whoami
# printed 'chalda'

# to run nex commands as user 'root'
su -
# adding new group to the system
groupadd docker
# adding account chalda to docker group
sudo gpasswd -a chalda docker
# start/restart docker daemon
sudo systemctl start docker

# run under 'chalda' and log in with 'chalda' to the just created 'docker' group
exit
newgrp docker
```

== Getting a docker image

Docker container is started from docker image. Image is an immutable snapshot of container.
When the docker image is started you've got a running docker container.
For starting the image it has to be available at the local docker cache. Docker cache contains
pulled docker images and locally built docker images. Usually they're stored under `/var/lib/docker`.
You can check https://stackoverflow.com/a/25978888/187035[the storage with the command]
`docker info` or `docker system info` (more specifically `docker info | grep 'Root Dir'`).

NOTE: If you want to check how much space is used by docker on your system you can verify
with `docker system df`. To https://bobcares.com/blog/how-to-clear-docker-cache-and-save-disk-space/2/[remove all the docker images]
and saving the drive space you can use command `docker system prune -a`
(see https://stackoverflow.com/a/45143234/187035[what are dangling images])

To get the docker image you need either to download it from the remote docker repository - causing
the image being saved in the local cache. Or build the image from `Dockerfile`
(normally includes downloading of images from the remote repository too, the parent docker images
are delcared by `FROM` declaration at `Dockerfile`) - causing the result image is stored in the local cache.

NOTE: I'm using here _old_ version of docker cli command prescription. For example I use here `docker pull`,
`docker build`. In the new better structured way you will say first what resource you work with - ie. here with the `image`
thus you use `docker image` and then you add the command. For example:
`docker image build` or `docker image pull`. +
In fact both ways are only aliases. The functionality of `docker build` and `docker image build` is the same.

=== Pull image from docker registry

For downloading the image from the remote repository serves command `docker pull`.
Let's say you want to get pulled PostgreSQL then you will do `docker pull docker.io/postgres`
or just `docker pull postgres`. If the image is not found at the local cache it tries
to be looked in predefined remote repository which is by default the `docker.io`.
To check more information about the image residing _in the docker.io remote repository_
see at https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres/.

For more info on naming docker images and pulling them, see my blog post
http://blog.chalda.cz/2017/12/15/Docker-tags-and-registries.html.

TIP: if you want to run some specific docker image you can search configured remote repository
with command `docker search`. For example to check images named with reference to PostgreSQL
you can do `docker search postgresql`

=== Build from Dockerfile

`Dockerfile` is a file (a file named _Dockerfile_) which defines
a recipe of https://medium.com/@jessgreb01/digging-into-docker-layers-c22f948ed612[combining existing docker images]
with bash shell commands. Build process generates a new docker image from it.
To check an example of `Dockerfile` you can clone my repository `git clone https://github.com/ochaloup/dockerfiles-test.git`
and look into folder `cd dockerfiles-test/postgresql` where `Dockerfile` resides.

`docker build` command requires path to a directory which contains `Dockerfile`, it takes it, process the commands in it,
and creates the docker image. It's important to note all commands in the `Dockerfile` is taken relative
to the directory where the `Dockerfile` resides. That's important for example in case of the `COPY` command (it takes files
from the host and copies them to the docker image) as location is considered appropriately.
Nevertheless it's quite usual to run the command from the folder where
https://github.com/ochaloup/dockerfiles-test/blob/master/postgresql/Dockerfile[`Dockerfile` file resides], a.k.a `docker build .`

NOTE: as far as I know there is no `docker` command switch which permits you
to point to a file named differently and working as the `Dockerfile` recipe.
You just need to go with the name _Dockerfile_.

If you have the `Dockerfile` then you use `docker build <path>` command to get the docker image.
You can try to run with the example PostgreSQL `Dockerfile` command `docker build .`.
After it is successfully executed you will end up with message like

```bash
Successfully built a93a78b4d156
```

The `a93a78b4d156` is the hash sum (image hash) marking identity of the image. You can use this hash
as image name to start the container from it. Or you can name the image with human readable name
http://blog.chalda.cz/2017/12/15/Docker-tags-and-registries.html[by tagging it]:
`docker tag a93a78b4d156 mypostgresql`.
Tagging can be done directly at build step too: `docker build . -t mypostgresql`.

More or less we can say a `Dockerfile` command creates a separate layer.
Layers are layered one on top of each other (see `docker history`).
When the layer is once built, it is saved. For the second time the checksum is verified and
if it matches built of the layer is not invoked but it's taken from the cache.
If you want to build without using cache data (downloading from scratch, building from scratch)
you can add parameter `--no-cache` to `docker build` command.

[NOTE]
====
If you like to check what is "the low-level content" (what is the metadata) of the image, try running `docker inspect <hash>` command.
(`docker inspect a93a78b4d156`). It will show you what are environmental variables bound to the image,
where the image is located on the drive, what are https://medium.com/@jessgreb01/digging-into-docker-layers-c22f948ed612[layers it's compounded from] etc.

The other useful command is `docker history <hash>` (`docker history -H --no-trunc a93a78b4d156`) which shows
_shell commands_ the Docker files is built from. It's kind of decompilation command from the docker image to the dockerfile.
The history is shown from the latest at the top and the oldest at the end.
====

=== Listing images at your system

For getting list of the pulled images you use command `docker images`. Those are images
available at your machine in the docker local cache.

Here don't be surprised with the column naming. There is http://blog.chalda.cz/2017/12/15/Docker-tags-and-registries.html[a bit confusion in it].
The column _REPOSITORY_ shows what we called here an _image name_ which is got when you _tag_ an image.
The column _TAG_ shows _a version_ of the image.

== Running docker container

If we have a docker image placed at the local machine we can run it `docker run <image_name>`

NOTE: command `docker run` can be supplemented not only with the image placed locally
  but you can use whatever tag. It will be first tried to be pulled from the remote repository
  before it's run.

If you run an image (let's say `docker run mypostgresql`) it's by default run in foreground
and it attaches the STDOUT and STDERR to the shell you started it from. You can use multiple
`docker run` https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#detached-vs-foreground[switches to change the behaviour]:

As said `docker run` runs by default in foreground and all information going to STDOUT is shown

```bash
docker run mypostgresql
...
... a lot of lines of text ...
...
PostgreSQL init process complete; ready for start up.

LOG:  database system was shut down at ...
LOG:  MultiXact member wraparound protections are now enabled
LOG:  database system is ready to accept connections
LOG:  autovacuum launcher started
```

To run container in background - aka. detached from the shell use `-d`.
When run the `docker` command prints out only the hash of the running docker container.

```bash
docker run -d  mypostgresql
1f375bfb9a3f31e88b3290da109ea51815097906c4e15b4cbb4a8c5f9e0a720b
```

When running in foreground you can say what are outputs you want to be attached to
with your shell. This is specified with switch `-a`. Taking our `mypostgresql`
image and run only STDERR being bound to the current shell then there is only
small number of printed lines you can see (only those printed to the STDERR are shown).

```bash
docker run -a stderr mypostgresql

WARNING: enabling "trust" authentication for local connections
You can change this by editing pg_hba.conf or using the option -A, or
--auth-local and --auth-host, the next time you run initdb.
LOG:  database system was shut down at ...
```

There is two important switches for foreground running of the container

* `-t` &ndash; allocation of pseudo-TTY
* `-i` &ndash; keep STDIN open even if no attached

These switches are usually used together as `-it` and they are both needed
if run some interactive command - ie. expecting writing commands to the running
docker container. Such command is for example `/bin/bash`. Thus for being able
to write shell commands you need to run `docker run -it mypostgresql /bin/bash`.
If you don't use `-it` you won't be able to write any command to the started `bash` command line
(or the input will be cryptic).

=== Changing Dockerfile CMD

What happened when we run `docker run -it mypostgresql /bin/bash`?

We overrode `CMD` command and changing it for `/bin/bash`. It means instead of starting
command `potgresql` we started command `/bin/bash`.

NOTE: there is no attempt to explain format of the Dockerfile in this blogpost,
see https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/[documentation]
for more information instead

Let's make a short sidestep - docker works only with one instance of commands
`CMD` and `ENTRYPOINT`. If there are more of them then only the last one is used.
`ENTRYPOINT` defines _a prefix_ for the command to be run (`CMD`). Let's say we have
following content of the `Dockerfile`.

```bash
FROM centos

ENTRYPOINT ["cat"]
ENTRYPOINT ["ls"]
CMD ["-la"]
```

If you create this simple `Dockerfile` and you run it the resulting
is translated to the command `ls -la`.

```bash
docker build . -t test
docker run test
```

Now how is it with that `CMD` replacing at the command line?
If we run `docker run test -d` then `CMD` of the `Dockerfile` is replaced by `-d`
defined at the command line.

Let's take a look at the more real `Dockerfile`.
This is what happened in case of `myposgresql` image. Check the output of `docker history`

```bash
docker history --no-trunc mypostgresql | grep 'CMD\|ENTRYPOINT'

e0c7250b6ea3   4 days ago   /bin/sh -c (nop)  CMD ["postgres"]
<missing>      4 days ago   /bin/sh -c (nop)  ENTRYPOINT ["docker-entrypoint.sh"]
<missing>      6 days ago   /bin/sh -c (nop)  CMD ["bash"]
```

If we run `docker run -it myposgresql /bin/bash` it's translated to be running `docker-entrypoint.sh /bin/bash`
(instead of `docker-entrypoint.sh postgres`). If you run with `/bin/bash` (you are staying in bash of the container)
you can verify the content of the `/docker-entrypoint.sh` file and see what happens there
and what  existence of the `postgres` parameter (normally provided by `CMD ["postgres"]`) causes.
Then tt the end of the entrypoint script there is defined `exec "$@"` which causes
our `/bin/bash` command line cmd parameter  is executed (resulting in running `exec /bin/bash`).

NOTE: you can override `ENTRYPOINT` from command line by using `--entrypoint` switch


=== docker run command to expose ports

If you run only the `docker run myposgresql` then database is started in the container
but it's not possible to contact it from outside. That's where we need to declare
that port inside of the container should be mapped to the port of the hosting system.
This is done with parameter `-p hosting_port:container_port`.

Running `docker run -p 5432:5432 myposgresql` then open port `5432` at hosting system
and map it on the container `5432` port. We can now connect to the database as usual.

=== docker run and exited containers

You can checked the running containers with command `docker ps`.
When you start the container and then stop it (either with `CTRL^C` or command `docker stop`)

```bash
docker run myposgresql
CTRL^C
```

such container is put to the _exited_ state. Such container is still available in the system (e.g. it still
occupies the space on the drive) but is stale. You can list all the _exited_ containers
by running `docker ps -a`.

You can start the _exited_ container  with command `docker start`.
To get printed output to the shell you can use `-ia` switch (attaching STDOUT/STDERR and STDIN)
like `docker start -ia $(docker ps -a | tail -n 1 | sed 's/ .*//')`.

NOTE: you can delete all exited containers with one-liner like this
`docker rm $(docker ps --all -q -f status=exited)`

Up to that you can create a new image from the _exited_ container with `docker commit`.
This gives you for example chance to start failed container with different
`CMD` or `ENTRYPOINT` defined.

```
docker commit <sha-exited-container> <new-image-name>
# starting the image but using shell as entrypoint thus filesystem structure could be verified
docker run -it --entrypoint /bin/bash NEWIMAGENAME
```

==== docker run omitting to save any exited container

If you don't plan to start the exited container afterwards and you don't want
the exited containers being left at your drive
after they are stopped then use `docker run --rm` switch. The stopped container will
be directly deleted (not going to _exited_ state). Try to run the `docker run --rm myposgresql`.

== Inspecting a running docker container

You can attach yourself to a running docker container using `docker exec`.

Let's say you run `docker run -d mypostgresql`, you get printed the sha of the running image
(e.g. _8550aa320664b46701034b81b1ec0d4cf426cd4540e21ece17894cec52a12afc_, or you can
check it by `docker ps` and get the shortened version of sha _8550aa320664_).

Now you can run

`docker exec -it <started container sha> bash`::
  to get bash for the started container, inspecting it, doing changes etc.
`docker exec -u 0 -it <started container sha> bash`::
  to get bash with root

If you want to check only standard output of the container you can use
`docker logs -t <container sha>`. This could be applied for running containers
but for exited ones too.

== Removing images and containers from the system

There are commands to remove the docker images and containers (when not in use)

`docker rmi <imagename>`::
  removing a docker image
`docker rm <container_name>`::
  removing a docker container

On fedora docker saves images and containers under `/var/lib/docker` directory.
You can check the amount of the space the docker images occupy with command `du -sh /var/lib/docker/*`.
If you want to clean your system from the docker images (it can't be restored afterwards)

```bash
# stopping containers
docker stop $(docker ps -a -q)
# delete containers
docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)
# delete images
docker rmi -f $(docker images -q -a)
```

For removing all the docker data from the system
you can use `docker system prune -a --volumes` as well.

== Dockerfile composition

I don't want to describe how to write a `Dockerfile` here. I would rather recommend articles

* http://kimh.github.io/blog/en/docker/gotchas-in-writing-dockerfile-en
* https://til.codes/docker-run-vs-cmd-vs-entrypoint

but I would like to mention few points that I was not able to understand when I started with Docker.

=== Dockerfile does not support multiple inheritance

Docker neither expect nor support multiple inheritance in container composition. If you have a complex
project structure then it's possible you will need to copy&paste the same parts of configuration
to multiple `Dockerfile` files. Or you can consider usage some 3rd party tools as for example
http://concreate.readthedocs.io which is used for building JBoss EAP docker images.

The tool let you split the project to multiple modules and then combines them into
one structured `Dockerfile`.

=== Dockerfile does not support any post-start hooks by default

Docker does not provide any way to run
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42280792/reuse-inherited-images-cmd-or-entrypoint[some hook like `post-start` or similar]
(this is where https://www.openshift.org[OpenShift] can help you).

As a newcomer I've had a dummy idea - creating my `Dockerfile`,
inheriting it from some parent (`FROM postgres`), letting the parent to start the database
service and then including some configuration shell script defined at my child `Dockerfile`.

...and that's not possible


* Only one *active* `CMD` and one `ENTRYPOINT` command in the whole `Dockerfile` hierarchy.
* There could be multiple `RUN` commands but they are executed during `Dockerfile` building,
  not at the time the docker runs the image.
* There is often used pattern of `ENTRYPOINT` creating a wrapper around `CMD` which
  is defined at the parent image. You would define `ENTRYPOINT ["starting-script.sh"]` where end
  of the `starting-script.sh` would define `exec $@`.
  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32255814/what-purpose-does-using-exec-in-docker-entrypoint-scripts-serve[It then executes the CMD]
  as parameter of the `ENTRYPOINT`. As example having
```bash
CMD ["ls -l"]
ENTRYPOINT ["starting-script.sh"]
```
  the Docker will evaluate it to run: `starting-script.sh "ls -l"`.

* The trouble is that many parent `Dockerfile` files use `ENTRYPOINT` and you would then override its functionality,
  (for example it's the case of the `postgres` image - try `docker history postgres`).
* Usually each docker image defines own specific way of running the configuration scripts
  after the service is started.
  For example for `postgres` docker image executes all shell and sql scripts copied to `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/` directory.
  You can check an example at https://github.com/ochaloup/dockerfiles-test/blob/master/postgresql/Dockerfile.
  The `postgres` container runs the scripts after database is started,
  and even it ensures the database is restarted later.
