== Asciidoctor and AsciiDoc and the others

image::articles/asciidoctor.png[asciidoctor as an ascii art]

`Asciidoctor` is a text processor and toolchain as stated https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor[in their github pages].
Under the term of text processor we can imagine a processor which gets on input a text _annotated_ by in
syntax and on output you get some _readable_ format like pdf. The `Asciidoctor` works with
http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc[AsciiDoc] markup language.

There are multiple other markup languages which serves for writing text and providing their toolchain
to provide text in well consumable/readable form.
The text processor based on XML is http://docbook.org[DocBook],
the well known for type setting is http://www.latex-project.org[LaTeX].
The html itself is a markup language where you put tags around your text and browser works
as the processor to show the text formatted.

The advantage is that you can write the text annotate it with a formatting syntax
and then with usage of the tools gets various output format - kind of html, pdf etc.

All the named markup languages have trouble that's the syntax delay you when you're writing
and is harder to read the raw text with formatting markup.

That's where http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc[AsciiDoc] or maybe better known
http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown[MarkDown] languages
and the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki_markup[Wiki Markup] could be counted too.
They are markup languages which aims to be easy to read and easy to write when
working with raw text and still easily covertable to formats like html or pdf.

I fell in low with `AsciiDoctor`. I'm not sure why exactly in this one but
but it seemed to me being a little more intuitive than `MarkDown`.
I use on day to day basis, whenever I need to write some notes (especially more structured)
or any kind of longer text.

== AsciiDoctor in more details

I know that the first idea to look at it came from JBoss Community podcast
http://jbosscommunityasylum.libsyn.com/podcast-32-is-there-an-asciidoctor-on-board[JBoss Community Aylum on Asciidoctor]
which provides quite a good portion information what is it about and what is it good for.

`Asciidoctor` is based on syntax of old Python `AsciDoc` markup language but it rewrites the processor to Ruby
and adds a many enhancements on top of it.
It's focused on writing documentation or technical type of text.

I learn to use https://atom.io[Atom] editor to write the text. There I use https://atom.io/packages/language-asciidoc[plugin to for syntax highligting]
(probably installed by default) and then https://atom.io/packages/asciidoc-preview[plugin to preview the text written in AsciiDoctor markup].
The shortcut `CTRL+SHIFT+A` started to be my beloved friend.

From writing text it was short way to use it for writing blog posts (see this blog and http://hubpress.io[Hubpress.io platform])
and using it for http://asciidoctor.org/docs/install-and-use-revealjs-backend[preparing presentation]. It's really my favorite
way as I can restructuralize the text with ease that is not possible in GUI editors.
I could use the pure http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js[Reveal.js] but usage of `AsciiDoc` makes writing
even easier.

== Syntax reference

* For getting known to its syntax look at http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference[Asciidoc Quick Referece].
* The cheatsheet I use is https://powerman.name/doc/asciidoc[AsciiDoc cheatsheet at PowerMan]
* The perfect guide to `AsciiDoctor` hacks is https://leanpub.com/awesomeasciidoctornotebook[Awesome Asciidoctor Notebook]

== Some HOWTOs

Nevertheless all the time when I start to learn something I normally don't like some small part of default behavior.
Here it's the fact that first paragraph after the title is presented as lead paragraph and it's highlighted.
I started to search and I get to understanding that each paragraph (block as formatable building block) gets `a role` by default.
In this case it should be role `lead` which could be defined by hand in text by putting the role name into square brackets preceded by dot - like `[.lead]`.
