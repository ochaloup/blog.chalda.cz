Understanding the error types in Solana is not easy to grasp.
At least it's my experience when working on a client application.
The aim of this article is to summarize facts that one get to used
when calling the Solana blockchain programs.
Here we will be using a Typescript client with a focus on Anchor program and client.

== How client sends

For the baseline of the understanding we need to shortly summarize
what is a default processing when one sends 
https://docs.solana.com/integrations/retrying-transactions[a transaction from a client to blockchain].

[source,typescript]
----
await connection.getLatestBlockhash()
const ix = SystemProgram.transfer({
    fromPubkey: fromKeypair.publicKey,
    toPubkey: wallet.publicKey,
    lamports: anchor.web3.LAMPORTS_PER_SOL,
})
const messageV0 = new web3.TransactionMessage({
  payerKey: payer.publicKey,
  recentBlockhash: blockhash,
  instructions,
}).compileToV0Message();
const txBuf = Transaction({
        ...latestBlockhash,
        feePayer: wallet.publicKey,
    })
    .add(ix)
    .serialize()
try {
    await provider.connection.sendRawTransaction(txBuf, {
    skipPreflight: false, // simulated == YES
    preflightCommitment: "processed",
    })
----

In the above code the client creates a transaction, the transaction is signed, serialized
and send to a RPC node.

https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-web3.js/blob/v1.78.4/packages/library-legacy/src/connection.ts#L238

[source,typescript]
----
/**
 * Options for sending transactions
 */
type SendOptions = {
    /** disable transaction verification step */
    skipPreflight?: boolean;
    /** preflight commitment level */
    preflightCommitment?: Commitment;
    /** Maximum number of times for the RPC node to retry sending the transaction to the leader. */
    maxRetries?: number;
    /** The minimum slot that the request can be evaluated at */
    minContextSlot?: number;
};
/**
 * Options for confirming transactions
 */
type ConfirmOptions = {
    /** disable transaction verification step */
    skipPreflight?: boolean;
    /** desired commitment level */
    commitment?: Commitment;
    /** preflight commitment level */
    preflightCommitment?: Commitment;
    /** Maximum number of times for the RPC node to retry sending the transaction to the leader. */
    maxRetries?: number;
    /** The minimum slot that the request can be evaluated at */
    minContextSlot?: number;
};

Some of those terms are old, but here's roughly how they would translate:
processed = recent
confirmed = singleGossip = single
finalized = root = max
if you choose "finalized" it means that you're running your transaction against a finalized block, and if you choose "processed", you're running your transaction against the most recent block

https://docs.solana.com/api/http#configuring-state-commitment
For preflight checks and transaction processing, Solana nodes choose which bank state to query based on a commitment requirement set by the client. 

[source,typescript]
----
/**
 * The level of commitment desired when querying state
 * <pre>
 *   'processed': Query the most recent block which has reached 1 confirmation by the connected node
 *   'confirmed': Query the most recent block which has reached 1 confirmation by the cluster
 *   'finalized': Query the most recent block which has been finalized by the cluster
 * </pre>
 */
type Commitment = 'processed' | 'confirmed' | 'finalized' | 'recent' | 'single' | 'singleGossip' | 'root' | 'max';
